<p>The ancestors of the bearers of the Southern tradition of folk-music began in
very ancient times the practice of singing religious songs to folk-tunes. Nor must
one think that this custom showed a lack of respect for religion. On the contrary,
it rather emphasized the respect and love of the folk for their traditional music. As
their most loved and treasured possession, they brought this noble musical heritage
and laid it on the altar of their worship. There is a strong probability that this
practice has continued unbroken for at least thirteen centuries. William of Malmsbury,
writing in the twelfth century, gives an anecdote of St. Aldhelm, the Anglo-Saxon
abbot of Malmsbury during the seventh century, which he took from the
notebook of King Alfred the Great, which was extant at that time. According
to this story, the Saint would station himself on a bridge in the guise of a gleeman
and would collect an audience by singing popular songs. He would then gradually
insert into his entertainment the words of the holy scriptures and so lead his hearers
to salvation. The chronicler also states that one of the popular songs made by
St. Aldhelm and mentioned by King Alfred was still being sung by the folk at the
time of his writing, almost five hundred years later.</p>
<p>Chappell, in his <i>Popular Music of the Olden Time</i>, says: &ldquo;We may date the
custom of singing hymns to secular tunes from this time [The Norman Conquest]
if, indeed, it may not be carried back to the time of St. Aldhelm. William of
Malmesbury records of Thomas, Archbishop of York (created in 1070), that
&lsquo;whenever he heard any new secular song or ballad sung by the minstrels, he
immediately composed parodies on the words to be sung to the same tune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a contribution to <i>Notes and Queries</i>, Mr. James Graves gives a curious list
of eight songs similarly parodied in <i>The Red Book of Ossory</i>, a manuscript of the
fourteenth century, which is preserved in the archives of that see. Six of the songs
are English (there are two parodies on one of them), and the remaining two are
Anglo-Norman. The Latin hymns seem to have been written by Richard de
Ledrede, Bishop of Ossory from 1318 to 1360. The names of the six English songs
are as follows:</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, the early Presbyterians continued this usage, as is
evidenced by Wedderburn&rsquo;s hymnal published in Edinburgh in 1560, quaintly
entitled: <i>Ane Compendius Booke of Godly and Spirituall Songs, Collected out of
Sundrie Parts of the Scriptures, with Sundrie of Other Ballates Changed out of
Prophaine Songs, for Avoiding of Sin and Harlotrey</i>. Among these latter was a
parody of &lsquo;John, Come Kiss Me,&rsquo; the wide and enduring popularity of which is
attested by its inclusion in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s <i>Virginal Book</i>, Playford&rsquo;s <i>Introduction,
Apollo&rsquo;s Banquet for the Treble Violin</i>, Walsh&rsquo;s <i>Division Violin</i>, Playford&rsquo;s
<i>Division Violin</i> and <i>Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>. There are also references to it in
Thomas Heywood&rsquo;s <i>A Woman Killed with Kindness</i>, <i>Westminster Drollery</i>, Burton&rsquo;s
<i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, <i>The Scourge of Folly</i>, Braithwaite&rsquo;s <i>Shepherd&rsquo;s Tales</i>, <i>Tom
Tiler and his Wife</i>, and Henry Bold&rsquo;s <i>Songs and Poems</i>. Allan Cunningham quotes
the parody in <i>The Songs of Scotland, Ancient and Modern</i>, as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">John, come kiss me now,</p>
<p class="t0">John, come kiss me now,</p>
<p class="t0">John, come kiss me by and by,</p>
<p class="t0">And make nae mair ado.</p>

<p>A similar book appeared in 1642, called: <i>Psalms, or Songs of Zion, turned into the
language and set to the tunes of a strange land, by William Slatyer, intended for Christmas
Carols and fitted to divers of the most noted and common but solemn tunes, everywhere
in this land familiarly used and known</i>. That the Puritans of that century did
not invariably confine themselves to &ldquo;solemn tunes&rdquo; is indicated by Shakespeare
when the Clown in <i>The Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>, in praising the vocal prowess of the shearers,
assembled for the sheep-shearing feast, says: &ldquo;Three-man song-men, all, and very
<span class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
good ones...; but one Puritan amongst them, and he sings Psalms to
hornepipes.&rdquo; In the <i>New Variorium Shakespeare</i>, H. H. Furness, in commenting
on the passage, says: &ldquo;He sings Psalms to the lively tunes to which horn-pipes
were danced,&mdash;a practice which, we know was extremely popular in France, and
from allusions like the present we can infer that it was not unknown in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Puritan congregations of New
England are said to have had music committees one of the chief duties of which
was to go among the folk and gather attractive melodies to be used as hymns. And
this was also the custom of the Primitive Methodists, both in Great Britain and in
America. In writing of this usage at a later date, Chappell says: &ldquo;The Primitive
Methodists ... acting upon the principle of &lsquo;Why should the devil have all the
pretty tunes?&rsquo; collect the airs which are sung at pot and public houses, and write
their hymns to them ... in this sect we have living examples of the &lsquo;puritans who
sing psalms to horn-pipes,&rsquo; They do not mince the matter by turning them into
slow tunes, ... but sing them in their original lively time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brings us to the nineteenth century, in which appeared the &ldquo;shape-note
hymnals&rdquo; from which the material in this volume is chiefly drawn. The existence
of these books was scarcely known to musicians and music-lovers until recently,
when they were vividly brought to the attention of the musical world by Dr. George
Pullen Jackson in his book, <i>White Spirituals in the Southern Uplands</i>. Music lovers
were astonished to learn of the existence of these old books, containing a wealth
of uniquely beautiful hymn-tunes, largely folk-tunes and others composed in the
same idiom. A majority of these are in the old modes and among them are the
tunes of folk-songs, ballads, country-dances and even morris-dances. But musicians
were even more surprised to learn that there are literally hundreds of thousands
of devotees, in homes, in little gatherings and big singing conventions covering a
broad region which stretches from the Valley of Virginia to the plains of Texas,
who enthusiastically preserve and practise this tradition. That this usage should
have lived on from pioneer times into our present day, when not only what we buy
but what we are, is stereotyped by the processes of mass production, seems little
short of miraculous. But it is explained by the innate vigour of the tradition itself,
by the great love of the tradition-bearers for the old tunes and, not least, by the
fact that the books embodying the material used shape notes.</p>
<p>Shape notes, as is explained in <i>White Spirituals</i>, indicate their pitch by their
shapes, independently of the lines and spaces of the staff. They were invented to
simplify the reading of music. There are two principal systems, the Four Shape
and the Seven Shape. In the Four Shape, the first and fourth degrees of the scale
are called <i>fa</i> and are represented by a right triangle; the second and fifth are called
<i>sol</i>, represented by a round shape; the third and sixth, <i>la</i>, by a square head and
the seventh, <i>mi</i>, by a diamond. The Seven Shape system has a different form of
note for each degree of the scale and the nomenclature accords with our general
practice. The nomenclature of the Four Shape system is of especial interest because
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
it was known and practised by Shakespeare. Numerous references to it occur in his
plays. In <i>King Lear</i> this system is employed in an almost Wagnerian manner to
characterize the archvillain, Edmund, who in soliloquy says: &ldquo;My cue is villanous
melancholy&rdquo; and then sings: &ldquo;Fa, sol, la, mi.&rdquo; These four tones measure the extent
of a tritone, the forbidden interval called the <i>diabolus</i> or the devil and supposed
to be filled with sinister, ominous and evil potency.</p>
<p>As shape notes increased in popularity, bitter controversy arose between their
supporters and those of the ordinary staff notes. This was most fortunate, for it
gave the fa-sol-la folk a coherence and a sturdier determination to abide by their
principles and practices, which enabled them to resist the erosion of modern life
and so preserve their beautiful heritage.</p>
<p>Many folk-tunes associated with sacred words have been passed down also
solely by the process of oral tradition. Mr. Ernest La Prade, author of <i>Alice in
Orchestralia</i>, recently learned of two groups of Primitive Baptists, one in New
Jersey and the other in Philadelphia, which still use in their worship only tunes
preserved by this process. He was fortunate enough to record several of the hymns
from a member of the New Jersey congregation, some of which were modal and all
of which were of the type contained in the shape-note books.</p>
<p>The value of these books to students and lovers of our folk-music is incalculable.
For although many of the tunes are still extant in the oral tradition, a large portion
of them, of indubitable folk origin, have vanished from the oral tradition and, but
for these books, would be entirely lost. All who are familiar with the folk-dance
revival in England realize the importance of Playford&rsquo;s <i>English Dancing Master</i>
in preserving a large number of tunes and dances that were no longer traditionally
extant. The folk material embodied in the shape-note books is no less important
and far more varied; it is, in fact, indispensible to all who desire a comprehensive
knowledge of British and American folk-music.</p>
<p>Gratitude is due Dr. Jackson for making this material accessible to the public,
and admiration, for the painstaking and scholarly way in which he presents his
fascinating subject. The tunes are historically important in showing approximately
the state of the oral tradition at the time they were written down in the past century.
It would be difficult to overestimate their esthetic value. In metrical and rhythmic
structure, especially in balance and contrast in phrase lengths; in beauty and
eloquence of melodic line, many are unsurpassed by even the best of our traditional
tunes. It is not too much to hope that a revival of interest in this music may result
in a general use of it in our churches, where its native vigour, unaffected straightforwardness
and lyric beauty could go far in freeing us from the insipid banalities
of much present-day church music.</p>

<h2 id="ch2"><span class="h2line1">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>Since the sort of folk-song indicated by the title of this book is in all probability
unfamiliar to many, I shall assume that my chief task in this Introduction is to
make its nature clear. The first step in this explanation will be to distinguish the
present material from some other better known sorts of folk-song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it mountain songs you are collecting? Is it those old ballads?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it the
negro spirituals?&rdquo; These questions were put to me again and again by interested
persons while the present collection was in the making.</p>
<p>No, these are not mountain songs and still they are. What do we mean by
mountain songs? The very first mountain song I ever recorded was sung to me
on the treeless flats of North Dakota. It had arrived there from Kentucky by way
of Saint Louis and Los Angeles and had been carried over this circuitous route to
its northwestern place of recording by the singers in three generations of one
family. The first sailor&rsquo;s shanty I ever heard was in the mountains of Virginia. It
had come from a logging camp in Michigan by way of Chicago. Every folk-song
hunter can tell similar tales; and all such experiences convince us that the naming
of a type of song after a restricted region or a particular environment, while
furnishing a convenient designation, may lead also to much misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The mountain songs designation is one of the least appropriate. Its only
justification lies in the fact that some types of traditional song, the secular ballads
among them, have persisted perhaps in larger numbers in mountainous regions
like those of the southern Appalachians and the Ozarks and are more widely sung
there than elsewhere. These songs were Irish, Scotch, and English across the
water. They came from highlands and lowlands. They were the common possession
of early Americans of those ethnic stocks,&mdash;those people who never left the
tidewater parts, those who came into the highlands and settled there, and those
greater numbers who trekked through the mountain gaps, down the western
slopes and spread into the rolling country and plains. The present collection is of
songs sung by all these people in all of these parts in early and more recent times
and now. Hence, to call them &ldquo;mountain songs&rdquo; would be quite inadequate and
misleading.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Those who asked if the present collection were to be of the &ldquo;old ballads&rdquo; manifested
by their question some acquaintance with one variety, an important one
withal, of traditional secular folk-song in America. My answer to them was negative,
as it is to my present readers. This collection is made up neither of the secular
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
ballads nor of their close relatives, the secular folk-<i>songs</i>, as far at least as their
<i>texts</i> are concerned. Nor is it a collection of negro spirituals or negro songs of any
kind. And yet it is one of folk-songs, and spiritual ones, as its title truthfully
indicates. I shall now attempt to explain this; for it must seem to some an anomaly.
The explanation will necessitate my making a brief survey first of recent
trends in the activities of those interested in folk-songs.</p>
<h3 id="c3"><i>Recent Trends in Song Search</i></h3>
<p>Until recent years practically all the folk-songs published in America have
been those with secular texts. The existence of traditional spiritual folk-songs in
this land seems not to have been recognized by folklorists. Negro songs were, to
be sure, largely spiritual and they have been regarded as folksongs; but that was
an entirely different matter, one in which the students of the white man&rsquo;s culture
were not primarily interested. Early curiosity as to the &ldquo;slave songs&rdquo; was not
academic. It was rather a popular interest allied with one which was of a missionary-religious
nature. The songs themselves, as they became known in northern
and eastern centers during the post-Civil War period through the activities of
traveling concert groups from southern negro schools, were popularly believed in
those parts to be the negroes&rsquo; own creations and to be rooted in Africa. They were
regarded thus as lying essentially outside the sphere of the white man&rsquo;s cultural
traditions. These attitudes of mind tended to hold apart the two groups, those
concerned with the white man&rsquo;s song traditions and those interested in the religious
songs of the black folk. It was a negro-song apologist, Henry E. Krehbiel, who
signed, as he thought, the decree of complete separation of the two song bodies
with his book <i>Afro-American Folk Songs</i> in 1914; and for most people that was
definitive. Even as late as the end of the 1920&rsquo;s Krehbiel&rsquo;s word stood practically
unchallenged. I shall adduce evidence presently however of the error of his
assumption.</p>
<p>In the mean time knowledge of our own American folk-songs deepened and
broadened. The earlier interest, one which grew out of the soil tilled by Francis
J. Child and was confined to the ballads alone, shorn of their tunes, expanded in
the latter part of the second decade of the present century into one which included
also folk-<i>songs</i> and the tunes of both ballads and songs. Notable among folklorists
with this more comprehensive outlook was the late Cecil J. Sharp who,
after long experience in the English folk-song field, took up the hunt in the
southern Appalachians. Even the first collection of a part of his findings, published
in 1917, provided a revelation as to the wealth of the existing material and was
recognized as a model in the matter of musical recording. From then on, the
gathering of folk-songs was carried on with renewed enthusiasm and with greater
stress laid on the melodies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>One phase of song hunting began in the middle of the 1920&rsquo;s outside the circle
of the folklorists and in complete ignorance of the facts that what was sought was
genuine folk material. I refer to the study in the field of the southern religious
&ldquo;country singings&rdquo;. I make this charge of ignorance the more unhesitatingly
since it was my own, and since I worked alone in that field for some years. A
report of the early stages of my work appeared in 1933 in a volume entitled <i>White
Spirituals in the Southern Uplands</i>. Readers of that book have probably recognized
that, while I may have told the story of the country singing institution quite
thoroughly, I realized then only dimly that the songs under observation were folk-traditional.
This realization has come since then gradually, first by reason of a
series of accidental findings and more recently as the result of rather extended study.</p>
<p>Why the folklorists never came upon this material before it fell into my hands is
not hard to explain. One reason is that the strongest link binding the songs in
question to the traditional secular folk-songs is their <i>tunes</i>, and all musical considerations
were generally neglected, especially by the earlier folklorists in this land.
Another reason was probably that folklorists never thought, any more than I did,
of singing <i>groups</i> which used <i>song books</i>, as likely environment for their search.
A third reason was that the country songs were <i>religious</i>, a sort which was and is
still generally thought of as <i>church music</i> and thus as being far removed from the
folk. And finally, collectors have as a rule sought folk-songs in the mountains
and other <i>remote</i> places; whereas the country singings are found in the less sparsely
populated parts of the lower uplands.</p>
<p>Cecil Sharp should have escaped much of this prejudice and misconception; for
his own British Isles are full of religious folk-songs, as he well knew; even though
they do not appear there to any extent in a group-singing environment. But that
he did not escape it is indicated clearly by his experience in the southern mountains,
as he tells of it in the Introduction to his <i>English Folk Songs from the Southern
Appalachians</i>. When he came to a home in the mountains and made known his
desire to hear songs, he was generally misunderstood. The mountain people
thought he wanted to hear them sing &ldquo;hymns&rdquo;. But he did not; and though he
does not tell us why, he indicates that it was because he was convinced that the
&ldquo;hymns&rdquo; were not folk-songs. At any rate, he soon learned to ask for &ldquo;love songs&rdquo;.
And as a result there appeared but two songs of a religious nature, the &lsquo;Cherry
Tree Carol&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hicks&rsquo; Farewell&rsquo;, among the 122 in his first publication. In the
subsequent two-volume collection of his American findings, edited by Maud
Karpeles and published in 1932, we find a group of but half a dozen religious songs
under the heading &ldquo;Hymns&rdquo;. There are also a few biblical ballads in the collection.</p>
<p>Some years after Sharp missed all but completely his opportunity to become the
discoverer, or uncoverer, of American religious folk-songs, one of his English co-workers,
Anne G. Gilchrist, found some remarkable analogies between the secular
folk-songs of England on the one hand and the spiritual songs of the early Primitive
Methodists of that land and the early American revivalists on the other;
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
and she published a report of her research in the <i>Journal of the [English] Folk-Song
Society</i>, viii (1927-1931), pp. 61-95, in an article entitled &ldquo;The Folk
Element in Early Revival Hymns and Tunes.&rdquo; This was a real though brief contribution
to the very subject which engages us here; for it demonstrated the
linking of the nineteenth century religious songs with the older and principally
secular folk tradition of her land.</p>
<p>At about the same time, two Americans made smaller contributions. Ethel
Park Richardson recorded eleven of the white man&rsquo;s &ldquo;spirituals&rdquo; from oral tradition,
as it seems, and included them in her <i>American Mountain Songs</i>; and Samuel
E. Asbury furnished the Texas Folk-Lore Society with a group of camp-meeting
songs which he had heard in the 1880&rsquo;s in western North Carolina. The Society
published them in 1932.</p>
<p>On Miss Gilchrist&rsquo;s pages and even more often on the pages of American
collectors in the late 1920&rsquo;s appeared indications of a growing belief that the old
white spirituals were the progenitors of the negro spirituals and that, therefore,
Krehbiel&rsquo;s assumption as to negro authorship of the slave songs was in a measure
erroneous. Among those who shared constructively in this belief were Newman I.
White and Guy B. Johnson. Mr. White consulted a number of the old country-song
manuals to good advantage in the preparation of his <i>American Negro Folk-Songs</i>.
His use of them was to find merely <i>textual</i> antecedents of negro spiritual
borrowings. Mr. Johnson used some of the same manuals happily in the preparation
of his <i>Folk Culture on St. Helena Island</i>. His purpose, like that of Mr.
White, was to show negro song sources; but his work had the added merit of
calling attention to some <i>musical</i> analogies between the spiritual songs of the
white and the black Americans. My own contributions to the solution of the
problem of negro song sources are mentioned on <a class="pgref" href="#Page_9">page 9</a> of this Introduction. All
this evidence assumes considerable weight in proof of the thesis that the negro
spirituals, instead of lying outside the white people&rsquo;s song tradition, represent a
selective adoption and carrying-on of that tradition.</p>
<p>If the preceding paragraphs have in a measure made clear the nature of the
songs to be presented here, they have done so by the method of elimination and by
a review of some of the directions taken recently by students of song, trends which
seem to have led inevitably to the uncovering of the body of song found in the old
manuals of the country singers and to the establishing of its status as folk-song.
It is the revealing of this material and the establishing of its identity which are the
chief reasons for the existence of the present volume.</p>
<h3 id="c4"><i>Varieties of Religious Songs</i></h3>
<p>The old song books spoken of above contain various sorts of religious pieces.
Among these are the early psalm tunes, evangelical hymns, spiritual songs,
religious ballads, &ldquo;fuguing&rdquo; songs, and anthems. Each of these varieties represents
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
loosely a phase of, or a period in, religious, musical, or poetic development. Some
are folk-songs and many are not. The psalm tunes with their Old-Testament
texts&mdash;the sober song fare of the early Protestants in Europe, in the British Isles,
and in the American Colonies&mdash;are probably to some extent of folk origin; but
since psalm singing in early America can not be looked on as a free expression of
the folk, and since the psalm tunes themselves gave way easily to other far more
folky types of religious song, I have chosen to exclude them from the present
discussion and collection. The fuguing songs are examples of an early American
art development in composing and in group singing in New England during
the latter part of the eighteenth century. Despite their enduring popularity in
southern rural folk-singing circles and despite the fact that many of them are found
to be constructed on the basis of folk-melodic themes, I have decided that they
would be inappropriate to this collection. The same objection, that they are of an
essentially <i>composed</i> nature, holds also for the anthems and has demanded their
elimination.</p>
<p>After making these exclusions I centered attention on three mutually rather
distinct types of song all of which seemed to be in varying degrees folk products&mdash;the
<i>religious ballads</i>, <i>hymns</i>, and <i>spiritual songs</i>.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Religious Ballads</h3>
<p>The religious ballads by and large are folk-produced beyond any reasonable
doubt. They are uniformly songs for individual singing, not for groups. The sung
<i>story</i> was the thing. In one ballad it would be the story of some bad woman, Wicked
Polly for example, &ldquo;who died in sin and deep despair&rdquo; and went to hell; in another,
of some good woman, the Romish Lady for instance, who was burned at the
stake for espousing the Protestant cause. Much ballad material was furnished also
by the Bible. Scriptural events like the curing of the man sick with the palsy, the
restoring of sight to blind Bartimeus, Daniel&rsquo;s experience in the lions&rsquo; den, the
raising of Lazarus, the baby Moses in the rushes, the Prodigal Son parable, the
birth of Christ, His crucifixion and death,&mdash;all are retold in the ballads.</p>
<p>A younger variety of song which I include under the heading of <i>religious ballads</i>
is that in which the singer tells his story in the first person. Such stories are those
of the poor wayfaring stranger just a-going over Jordan, the departing preacher
or missionary, a dying boy or girl, and even a pious gold hunter dying on his way
to California. The story may be also the plaint of the religious &ldquo;mourner&rdquo;, the
backslider, and the criminal sinner, or the exultant tale of the saved. Still another
group of ballads is aimed more directly at the conversion of the &ldquo;young, the gay,
and proud.&rdquo; They usually begin by telling the religious experience of the singer
and close with a warning as to the tragic results of worldliness and an exhortation
to turn from &ldquo;this vain world of sin.&rdquo; These songs are quite similar to the worldly
ballads in form, and their tunes are, as will be pointed out presently, of the common
folk stock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h3 id="c6">Folk-Hymns</h3>
<p>The ballads (excepting the <i>experience</i> variety) probably did not originate in any
particular organized religious movement. The folk-hymns were, on the other
hand, bound up genetically with the protestant evangelical activity which followed
John Wesley&rsquo;s lead in England and then in America. The Wesleyan Revival
began as an ordered small-group affair and spread and developed ultimately into
a movement whose aspects and practices were completely free-affairs of the uninhibited
masses. In the same way the song of that movement, beginning with
merely the taste of textual freedom offered by Watts and the Wesleys, and
of musical freedom offered by those who furnished the melodies, spread ultimately
far beyond the &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; tunes and hymn texts of the authorities until religious
gatherings were musically completely liberated.</p>
<p>When John Wesley picked up a popular melody here and there on his travels
through England and set it to a good hymn text, he little realized that he was
setting an example and starting a movement which was to bring into existence
hundreds of folk-hymns; that is, songs with old folk-tunes which everybody could
sing and with words that spoke from the heart of the devout in the language of the
common man.</p>
<p>With the spread of this movement to America a fertile soil for its further development
seems to have been found. Here it became known as the Great Southern and
Western Revival. Here its store of songs, made after the pattern used in England,
was greatly enlarged. In fact the masses took the matter of what they were to sing
so completely into their own hands that the denominational authorities, especially
the Methodists, though they tried to control it, became helpless.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In looking through the folk-hymns in the second part of this collection one will
see scores of tunes which are clearly recognizable as those still sung to &lsquo;Barbara
Allen&rsquo;, &lsquo;Lord Lovel&rsquo; and other ancient ballads. This is adequate evidence, I
assume, as to where the folk sought and found its hymn tunes. The extent of this
tune borrowing process is indicated on <a class="pgref" href="#Page_18">page 18</a>f of this Introduction. The texts,
on the other hand, may be from the pen of Watts or other eighteenth century
English religious poets, or they may be the humbler creations of rural American
religious verse makers, like John Adam Granade, or John Leland.</p>
<p>It is impossible to date the beginning of folk-hymn making and singing in
America definitely. But on the assumption that they were a part of the Wesleyan
movement, we cannot place the beginning of their general use in America before
the 1770&rsquo;s. The part of the land where they first attained popularity&mdash;again
judging by their Wesleyan affinities&mdash;was the upland and inland South; for
during the last two decades of the eighteenth century (the time of the first spread
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
of the Methodist movement) four-fifths of the adherents to this sect were to be found in that
section.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<h3 id="c7">Revival Spiritual Songs</h3>
<p>The revival spiritual songs represent a further advance of the song movement
which brought forth the folk-hymns, toward the folk level. As the eighteenth
century expired the post-Wesleyan religious tide was high and the camp meeting,
the significant institution which became the cradle of the revival spiritual songs,
was born. One may therefore get a clearer insight into this new song development
if one recalls the character of its early environment. One might well remember,
for example, that the camp meetings began and remained in nature surroundings,
in the wilderness; that they were immense holiday gatherings;<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> that they thus took
on the free-and-easy aspects of the pioneers as a whole rather than of any particular
class; and that they were completely free from denominational and all other
authoritarian control.</p>
<p>Bearing all this in mind it is perhaps easier to understand how the folk-hymns&mdash;grown
up in a less boisterous environment&mdash;failed to satisfy the new conditions. At
the camp meetings it was not a question of inducing every one to sing, but of letting
every one sing, of letting them sing songs which were so simple that they became
not a hindrance to general participation but an irresistible temptation to join in. The
tunes of the folk-hymns were adequate. But the texts (Watts, Wesley and their
schools) still demanded a certain exercise of learning and remembering which excluded
many from the singing. The corrective lay in the progressive simplification
of the texts; and it was in the main this text simplification which brought about
and characterised the type of camp-meeting song which was called, in contradistinction
to all other types, the spiritual song.</p>
<p>The methods of song-text reducing are familiar. When the American youth sings</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Found a horse-shoe, found a horse-shoe,</p>
<p class="t0">Found a horse-shoe, just now;</p>
<p class="t0">Just now found a horse-shoe,</p>
<p class="t0">Found a horse-shoe just now</p>
</div>
<p>he is not only following a practice of the early spiritual song makers and singers&mdash;his
horse-shoe song itself is a parody of a spiritual in this collection&mdash;but he is
singing in the infinitely older manner of his race. He is singing an organically
constructed tune and refusing to let words interfere with it, a tendency which may be
observed from &lsquo;Sumer is icumen in&rsquo; to the nineteenth century songs of sailors and
to other work-songs and children&rsquo;s songs, like that of &lsquo;The Big Bad Wolf&rsquo;, today.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The text simplification in religious folk-songs began modestly. The variety of
spiritual song which is closest to the folk-hymn is that in which each short stanza
of text (four short lines usually) is followed by a chorus of the same length, as for
example:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">On Jordan&rsquo;s stormy banks I stand</p>
<p class="t0">And cast a wishful eye,</p>
<p class="t0">To Canaan&rsquo;s fair and happy land</p>
<p class="t0">Where my possessions lie.</p>
<p class="t2"><i>Chorus</i></p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;m bound for the promised land,</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;m bound for the promised land;</p>
<p class="t0">O who will come and go with me?</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;m bound for the promised land.</p>
</div>
<p>The verse was mastered probably by comparatively few singers, even though it may
have been &ldquo;lined out&rdquo; by the song leader. But the whole assemblage had its
chance to join lustily in singing the chorus.</p>
<p>A simpler form of spiritual song went directly into a refrain after the first text
couplet:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O when shall I see Jesus</p>
<p class="t0">And dwell with him above,</p>
<p class="t2"><i>And shall hear the trumpet sound</i></p>
<p class="t2"><i>In that morning.</i></p>
<p class="t0">And from the flowing fountain</p>
<p class="t0">Drink everlasting love,</p>
<p class="t2"><i>And shall hear the trumpet sound</i></p>
<p class="t2"><i>In that morning</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>Then came the chorus:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Shout O glory</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>For I shall meet above the skies</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And shall hear the trumpet sound</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>In that morning.</i></p>
</div>
<p>An offspring of this same &lsquo;Morning Trumpet&rsquo; song may serve to illustrate the
next step in simplification, one in which the singers, instead of using new poetic
lines in subsequent stanzas, were satisfied with slight variations of those already
sung:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, brother, in that day</p>
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;ll take wings and fly away,</p>
<p class="t2"><i>And we&rsquo;ll hear the trumpet sound</i></p>
<p class="t2"><i>In that morning.</i></p>
<p class="t0">Oh, sister, in that day</p>
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;ll take <i>etc.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, preachers, in that day,</p>
</div>
<p>and so on, with &ldquo;leaders,&rdquo; &ldquo;converts,&rdquo; etc. without end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The next step is seen in those songs where one short phrase is sung three times
and then followed by a one-phrase refrain:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Where are the Hebrew Children,</p>
<p class="t0">Where are the Hebrew Children,</p>
<p class="t0">Where are the Hebrew Children?</p>
<p class="t2"><i>Safe in the promised land.</i></p>
</div>
<p>These songs were sometimes called &ldquo;choruses,&rdquo; for they are often really nothing
else,&mdash;detached choruses, the text varied a bit from verse to verse, functioning as
complete songs.</p>
<p>The last word in brevity of text is where simply one short phrase or sentence,
sung over and over, is made to fill out the whole tune frame as a stanza.
&lsquo;<a href="#g_DeathAintYouGotNoShame">Death, Ain&rsquo;t You Got No Shame</a>&rsquo;, in this collection is one example among many. Such
songs as this were too meager to be welcomed warmly into the old song books.
They survive therefore chiefly in oral tradition. But meagerness of text is not,
we must remember, any criterion of the worth of a religious folk-song. &lsquo;Hebrew
Children,&rsquo; for example, the song from which I have just cited a stanza, is at once
extremely chary of words and rich in tonal beauty. This becomes evident when
one sees Annabal Morris Buchanan&rsquo;s arrangement of it for modern chorus.</p>
<p>It was the <i>spiritual songs</i>, rather than the <i>hymns</i> or the <i>ballads</i>, which appealed
subsequently most deeply to the negroes and have reappeared most often among
the religious songs of that race. In <i>White Spirituals</i> I presented twenty different
negro songs and traced them, both tunes and texts, directly to as many early
religious songs of the white people. In the present collection upwards of 60 songs
have been found to be the legitimate tune-and-words forebears of the same number
of negro spirituals. (Incidentally, all of the songs just used here to illustrate the
steps in text simplification have been borrowed by the black man and made over.)
These negro offspring songs are mentioned by title, and information as to where
I found them is given in the notes under each of the songs concerned.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The <i>tunes</i> of the secular folk-songs came into the religious environment&mdash;into
the folk-hymns and spiritual songs&mdash;with little change. What <i>one</i> could sing
by himself to secular words <i>all</i> could sing in a gathering to religious words. The
new surroundings made only one added demand,&mdash;that the singers indulge in
fewer vocal liberties than they might have enjoyed when singing the same tunes
in their homes and alone. I refer to those liberties in personal interpretation, a
quaint characteristic of individual folk singing which has given the collectors their
numerous variants of one and the same song. Group singers had now to agree on
one version of a tune and stick fairly closely to it. I say fairly closely, for the
religious singers allowed but few of their tunes to become completely standardized.
This will become clear when one studies the variants of certain folk-hymn and
spiritual-song tunes in this compilation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c8">Folk-Song Collectors of Yore</h3>
<p>In the earlier years of the camp-meeting movement, few if any of the songs
produced in and for that environment appeared in print. The whole body of
revival song was therefore generally known as &ldquo;unwritten music.&rdquo; The first
recordings were of the texts only. They appeared in the form of booklets and bore
some such title as &ldquo;Hymns and Spiritual Songs / for the Pious of all Denominations / as
Sung in Camp Meetings.&rdquo; They were prepared first by itinerant
preachers or song leaders who saw in the Great Revival a chance to serve the
cause, and perhaps to make money. That these books filled a great need is attested
by their ubiquity during the period which may be designated roughly as from
1800 to 1840.</p>
<p>The musical notation of the tunes they sang was the least concern of the revival
folk. It is quite probable that the camp-meeting crowds of those times never saw
their tunes in musical notation. It is evident that the first recordings of this
unwritten music were not made by the revivalists themselves, and that the first
book collections of such recordings were not made primarily for use in revivals.
The books in which these tunes first appeared were the country singing manuals of
which I have spoken above. The singing masters were quick to recognize the
value of the rousing revival songs and saw to it that their own institution benefitted
from their vogue. <i>The Christian Harmony</i>, published in New Hampshire in
1805 was perhaps the first book to record the revival tunes. <i>The Olive Leaf</i>, a
Georgia book of 1878 was the last.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>We sometimes have the compiler&rsquo;s own story of his sources. In the preface to
William Caldwell&rsquo;s <i>Union Harmony</i> for example, the compiler tells us that &ldquo;many
of the airs which the author has reduced to system [notated] and harmonized have
been selected from the unwritten music in general use&rdquo; among Baptists, Methodists
and Presbyterians. William Walker says, in the preface to his <i>Southern Harmony</i>,
&ldquo;I have composed parts to a great many good airs, which I could not find in any
publication or in manuscript, and assigned my name as the author.&rdquo; William
Hauser&rsquo;s preface to his compendious <i>Hesperian Harp</i> is lacking in my copy of
his work (the only copy in existence, I believe); but the compiler&rsquo;s method of
finding songs becomes clear when we peruse his pages of song. On the page with
&lsquo;<a href="#g_Patton">Patton</a>&rsquo;, for example, he notes that he first heard the Rev. William Patton, of
Missouri, sing the song which bears his name &ldquo;at a camp-meeting, North Cove,
Burk Country, North Carolina, in 1831 or 1832.&rdquo; The song entitled &lsquo;Houston&rsquo;
was an &ldquo;air I learned from my mother when a small child.&rdquo; As to &lsquo;<a href="#g_LandOfRest">Land of Rest</a>&rsquo; he
states that the &ldquo;inspiration of this tune [was] caught from a female voice at a
distance, at Barbee&rsquo;s Hotel, High Point, N. C., June 9th, 1868.&rdquo; Under the song
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
entitled &lsquo;Rev. James Axley&rsquo;s Song,&rsquo; in the same compiler&rsquo;s <i>Olive Leaf</i>, he tells who
the Rev. Axley was and how he, Hauser, came to record the preacher&rsquo;s favorite
tune. John G. McCurry gives a song called &lsquo;Good-By&rsquo; in his <i>Social Harp</i> and tells
that he put it down &ldquo;as played on the accordion by Mrs. Martha Hodges of Hartwell,&rdquo;
Georgia.</p>
<p>Instances like these cited above are numerous. They all go to convince us of the
great service rendered by the rural singing masters of yore in the preservation of
a body of song, in the collecting and publishing of which no one else seems to have
been interested.</p>
<p>The country singing books on which I have drawn for most of the songs of
this collection, are in the main those which were at my disposal while I was preparing
<i>White Spirituals in the Southern Uplands</i>. From the Georgia-Carolina section
were <i>The Southern Harmony</i> in its 1835 and 1854 editions; <i>The Southern and
Western Pocket Harmonist</i> (1845); <i>The Sacred Harp</i> which first appeared in 1844
but whose oldest edition at my disposal has been that of 1859; its three descendants,
<i>The Union Harp</i> (1909), <i>The Sacred Harp</i> (Cooper edition, 1902 and four subsequent
printings; I consulted the fifth reprint), and <i>The Original Sacred Harp</i>
(1911);<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> <i>The Hesperian Harp</i> (1848); <i>The Social Harp</i> (1855); <i>The Christian Harmony</i>
(1866); and <i>The Olive Leaf</i> (1878). Among the books originating in the
eastern half of Tennessee I searched <i>The Western Harmony</i> (1824); <i>The Columbian
Harmony</i> (1825); <i>The Union Harmony</i> (1837); <i>The Knoxville Harmony</i> (1838);
<i>The Harp of Columbia</i> (1848); and <i>The Western Psalmodist</i> (1853). From the Valley
of Virginia I used <i>The Kentucky Harmony</i> (1814); the German <i>Choral-Music</i>
(1816); <i>The Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony</i> (1820); <i>The Virginia Harmony</i>
(1831); <i>Genuine Church Music</i> (1832); and <i>The Union Harmony</i> (1848). From Saint
Louis I had <i>The Missouri Harmony</i> (1820). I found also some material in two
publications which are still in use among the Primitive Baptists, <i>The Primitive
Baptist Hymn and Tune Book</i> (1902) and <i>Good Old Songs</i> (1913).<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> Two books,
invaluable compendiums of the very sort of songs I was seeking, came to my hand
too late for consideration in <i>White Spirituals</i>. They were <i>The Revivalist</i>, published
in Troy, New York, in 1868; and Jeremiah Ingalls&rsquo; <i>Christian Harmony</i>, published
in New Hampshire in 1805. The latter contains scores of religious folk-songs&mdash;among
them many <i>spiritual songs</i>&mdash;which duplicate, though in variant forms, the
songs which are found in abundance in the southern country-song manuals. The
<i>Revivalist</i>, more than 60 years younger, is a veritable treasure trove of the same
sorts of song. Together the two books open new vistas as to the spread and active
life period of the song movement under observation. The New Hampshire book,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
made by a Vermont compiler, proves beyond doubt that the movement did not
remain in the South&mdash;the section of its first prevalence presumably and of its
present persistence&mdash;but spread early also into New England. The New York
book points definitely to the persistence of the tradition in the northeastern section
far longer than we would, without this evidence, have been warranted in assuming.</p>
<p>I went song hunting also among the authored hymn-and-tune-books of the
big denominations, but I found little, and that little was already familiar to me
from its appearance in the country-singing books.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Further information as to the identity of the books mentioned above may be
found in the Bibliography at the end of this volume. The abbreviations which
will be used in the body of this song collection when referring to the source song
books are explained in the List of Abbreviations of Titles.</p>
<h3 id="c9"><i>Features of American Folk-Tunes</i></h3>
<p>Even after recognizing the three types of religious folk-song as they are described
above, it was not always easy in particular instances, to decide on acceptance
into this collection or on rejection as non-folk material.</p>
<p>There are literally thousands of songs in the books searched. In the <i>Original
Sacred Harp</i> alone there are 609, and the <i>Hesperian Harp</i> holds 677. And while other
books are slimmer and duplications from book to book are numerous, it must still
be quite evident that it was no easy task to identify just the songs I was after. At
times I had to apply a number of criteria. Often the folky nature of the text
pointed to an equally folky tune. There was another hint sometimes in the name
given as that of the composer of the song. When I met with the names Moore,
Walker, Chapin, Breedlove, White, Carrell, Davisson, Hauser, McCurry and a
number of others, in the upper right corner of the song page, then I was practically
certain that the song on that page was usable. For the men in question were, in
reality, not composers. They were recorders and arrangers of unwritten music.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>When an example of the old unwritten music made its way into the authorized
church hymnals&mdash;as happened to a restricted degree from fifty to seventy-five
years ago&mdash;it was called a &ldquo;Western Melody&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Southern Melody.&rdquo; Such
designations became another reliable token of folk source.</p>
<p>More important than any external indications in determining whether I was
dealing in a particular instance with a folk-tune, was the character of the tune
itself. The ability to recognize a folk-tune comes to the student of such music
gradually, somewhat as does the recognition of a strange language or dialect. It
came to me that way; but after assembling my tunes I felt that their general folk
character might to some degree be reduced to a set of definite traits. I therefore
reexamined not only my own melodies but also those far more numerous tunes in
the secular collections of Sharp and others, for such characteristics as tonal trend,
rhythmic trend, tonality (modal character), and musical form. Since there is no
available definition of a folk-tune and since probably no succinct one can be made,
I am hoping that my deductions in the following paragraphs as to some earmarks
of American folk-tunes may be helpful to others who are interested in our
traditional melodism, as they have been helpful to me.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Tonal Trend, Tune Families</h3>
<p>The very beginning of a folk-tune has characteristic marks. The first accented
note is usually the tonic of its scale. In almost all cases this first-accent note is
preceded by an up-beat note which also is usually a tonic. The upbeat note coming
second in frequency is the lower 5 of the scale, with the higher 3 even less often thus
employed. The interval, if any, between the up-beat and the first accented note is
thus either an ascending fourth, an ascending third (in those cases where these
first two notes are 1 and 3) or descending third. And these intervals, though small,
are often broken or bridged by an unaccented intervening note. Tunes beginning
with an interval of a fifth (ascending 1 to 5 or descending 5 to 1) are quite rare.
Common folk-tune beginnings are thus:</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p003.jpg" alt="Music Snippets" width="600" height="109" />
</div>
<p>As to melodic trend within the body of the tune, I shall speak only briefly. It is
a broad subject, too broad to be discussed adequately in this connection. A survey of
my tune-thematic card catalog reveals, however, a few characteristics of this
melodic trend. The first is that the tunes assume usually an initial upward trend.
Another is that the steps or intervals employed are small, predominantly seconds,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
thirds, fourths, and fifths. Greater intervals are found however at the juncture
of two phrases. From these observations we may assume that the American folk-singer
does not like big intervals.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> This assumption, based on recorded tunes,
is strengthened when one listens to folk singing and notices their anticipatory
slides or scoops in approaching a tone that is only a little higher or lower than the
one just sung, a practice which may be interpreted as an anticipation of, and an
attempt to master, that which is vocally difficult. But while the individual jumps
from note to note are not as a rule great, the pitch compass of the entire tune is
often surprisingly wide. The melodies usually end in a descending cadence to the
tonic.</p>
<p>Along with the great variety in form which we meet among American folk-tunes,
there are certain melodic formulas which seem to be favorites and reappear with
unimportant variations as the tonal vestment of many different songs, so many
indeed that they might well be looked on as wandering tunes (reminding one
of the familiar wandering stanzas in folk texts) or, since they are not identical
from song to song, tune families.</p>
<p>In the present collection I have come upon six tune families of different sizes
and have named them in each instance after the song which seems to be the most
representative member of the family. They are the &lsquo;Lord Lovel&rsquo; family, cast in the
ionian mode; &lsquo;<a href="#g_IWillArise">I Will Arise</a>&rsquo;, aeolian and ionian; &lsquo;<a href="#g_Hallelujah">Hallelujah</a>&rsquo;, mixolydian; &lsquo;<a href="#g_Kedron">Kedron</a>&rsquo;,
aeolian; &lsquo;<a href="#g_BabeOfBethlehem">Babe of Bethlehem</a>&rsquo;, dorian; and &lsquo;<a href="#g_RollJordan">Roll Jordan</a>&rsquo;, ionian. The tunes in this
collection and elsewhere belonging to the &lsquo;Lord Lovel&rsquo; family are listed under the
song &lsquo;<a href="#g_Dulcimer">Dulcimer</a>&rsquo;. Those belonging to the other families are listed under the songs
for which the family is named.</p>
<h3 id="c11">Metrical Patterns</h3>
<p>In the matter of metrical patterns we find also a variety, and favorites. We have
noted the almost universal use of the up-beat. The up-beat initiates two different
rhythmic trends, one of which is the iambic, the prevalent one in American folk-tunes:
&sup2;/&#8324; &#9833; | &#9833;&prime;. This two-part type of accent unit (of notes or syllables, whichever
way we approach the matter), while occurring in series of four and three, as we
have seen, may be found occasionally also in twos, fives, and sixes. Indeed the
folk-tunes not infrequently show a refreshing independence of the demands of
perfect quadraticality. The other rhythmic trend initiated by the up-beat is the
less often used one made up of three-part units, which appear either in three-four
time, &frac34; &#9833; | &#9833;&prime; &#9833; or slow six-eight time,
&#8310;/&#8328; &#9834; | &#9834;&prime; &#9834;. With more notes (syllables) in
this single amphibrachic unit, the series of such units grows naturally in syllabic
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
length. It often outgrows thus its function as a mere melodic phrase and tends to
assume that of the melodic sentence. A fine example of this is in Sharp&rsquo;s recording
of the &lsquo;Cherry-Tree Carol&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But while the vast majority of folk-tunes follow one or the other of the above
described patterns, we must remember that metrical precision or mechanical
adherence to any formula is the least of the folk&rsquo;s concerns. Indeed, we should be
justified in assuming such exactness, as seen in text lines of carefully measured
lengths and in perfection of rhyme, to be sure signs of individual creative participation;
whereas greater freedom and variability in tune and text aspects are obviously
characteristic of the folk&rsquo;s vocalism.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Scales, Modes</h3>
<p>The folk-tunes of America are not, in the main, built up on scales of the diatonic
major and minor systems which, as is well known, have assumed their present form
under the demands of <i>harmony</i>; but on a modal system which grew out of <i>melodic</i>
exigences long before harmony made its conquest of the music of western civilisation.
Nor do the folk-tunes of this country make use of all the tones of even
these modal scales. They often employ but five or six of the seven available tones,
leaving characteristic gaps in such scales.</p>
<p>American folk-tune collectors have had their troubles in the interpretation of
modal melodies. I have had mine. Even such a life-long student of these things as
Cecil Sharp met many a knotty problem in classifying his Appalachian tunes. In
view of this difficulty I called on Hilton Rufty, a thorough musician and a reliable
authority in the folk-music field, to lend a hand in the modal classification of these
tunes. He generously acceded to my request; and by the time my requests had
ceased and before his generosity had been exhausted he had checked or corrected
all my modal classifications of the tunes in this collection. In making clear Mr.
Rufty&rsquo;s effective and practical method of identifying the character of tunes I shall
reproduce his Classification Chart and quote here his explanation of it.</p>
<h3 id="c13">Rufty&rsquo;s Classification; Chart of Tunes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In identifying the modal character of the &ldquo;gapped&rdquo; tunes I have deemed
it advisable to proceed by an entirely arbitrary method, free from any sort
of theoretical connotation. Should a missing tone be presupposed to
make either a major or minor, perfect or imperfect, interval with the tonic,
there arise at once ambiguities of modality. For purposes of harmonic
treatment it is quite necessary to decide upon which particular mode a
gapped tune suggests, but in studying the purely melodic aspects it is
reasonable to accept the tune as an entity, considering it in its actual tonal
structure and not with regard to its possible modal permutations. To
accomplish this purpose I have evolved a chart, based on methods used by
Cecil J. Sharp in his <i>English Folksongs from the Southern Appalachians</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
which for the great majority of the tunes in this collection is an adequate
system of classification. The arrangement of the chart is very simple: there
are five columns, each beginning with one of the five pentatonic scales.
Immediately below each pentatonic scale are four hexatonic scales which are
formed by the addition of the missing tones, singly and in their variable
positions. The system permits these variables to be read in terms of natural
and flatted tones. Lastly in each column are three regular heptatonic modes
which are the outgrowth of supplying both missing tones simultaneously
and in variable combination. The gaps in the pentatonic and hexatonic
scales are indicated by slurs and the numerical positions from the tonic
of the missing tones. The supplied missing tones are indicated by black
notes, and in fitting any given tune to any scale on the chart I have endeavored
where possible to let these black notes indicate the weak tones. Since
it was possible, so far as the <i>actual tonal structure</i> of the tunes was concerned,
to have a choice in the placing of them, the device of indicating weak tones
was a happy solution to a more careful classification. Above each tune in
this book I have indicated the modal and, following this and in parentheses,
the tonal pattern of the tune with the heptatonic scale as a norm, that is,
treating gapped tunes arbitrarily as broken-down heptatonic tunes. A
Roman numeral indicates a major or perfect interval with the tonic; an
Arabic numeral a minor interval. In event of augmented or diminished
fourths or fifths I have used conventional signs. A gap is indicated by a dash.</p>
<p>As a practical example of classification let us take at random, say, &lsquo;<a href="#g_WeepingSavior">Weeping Savior</a>&rsquo;,
a song of the present collection. Counting the tones of the melody
we find six with the sixth degree missing. We observe that the tune has
a major second, minor third, perfect fourth and fifth, no sixth, and a minor
seventh. By transposition we see that from a standpoint of the tonal pattern
alone the tune can be listed either as Hexatonic, Mode 2, A or Mode 4, b.
But the examination of structural detail shows clearly that 3 being a strong
tone and 2 being decidedly weak gives preference to the first classification
under Mode 2.</p>
<p>While pentachordal and hexachordal tunes (which do not conform to
this system of classification) may be perfect entities, I have, nevertheless,
for purposes of uniformity classified them on a heptatonic basis, that is,
as heptatonic tunes with the sixth and seventh, or seventh alone, missing
respectively. Similarly, while it is somewhat tautological to say, for instance,
a tune is heptatonic ionian, I have prefixed the term heptatonic
to facilitate identification and to balance the constantly recurrent pentatonic
and hexatonic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An examination of these spiritual folk-tunes reveals a great predominance of
gapped scales. Only 23 per cent of them use the full seven-tone series; 44 per cent
are hexatonic; 23 per cent are pentatonic; and seven tunes use only from 1 to 5
of their scale.</p>

<p class="pcap">CLASSIFICATION CHART OF TUNES</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The incidence of the different modes has been impossible to ascertain. We are
sure of a mode, as Mr. Rufty has noted, only when the scale tones are all represented
in the melody. Proceeding however in questionable instances according to
the more or less clear modal <i>implication</i>, I have found that about 52 per cent of
these tunes may be interpreted as ionian (major), about 30 per cent as aeolian, 7.5
per cent each as dorian<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> and mixolydian, and three tunes as phrygian.</p>
<p>I leave the interpretation of the significance of these figures to others. I venture
to suggest however that they will be found to indicate a survival of gapped and
modal tunes that is unique in the folk-music of today among peoples of European
stock.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>A modally constructed tune is, as I have indicated, almost sure to be a folk-tune.
And if a melody shows the characteristic gaps, its folk nature is quite assured.
Indeed, the complete filling-in of the gaps, creating two half steps, is a sign,
though not always a sure one, of art influence.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>The above paragraphs show in a general way a few of the more important and
evident <i>features by which American folk-tunes may be recognised</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> Their presence
or absence in specific cases has helped me to decide as to the fitness of a tune for
acceptance into this collection.</p>
<h3 id="c14"><i>Tunes of Religious and Worldly Folk-Songs Compared</i></h3>
<p>I have indicated above (<a class="pgref" href="#Page_6">page 6</a>) that many of the present tunes were borrowed
outright from secular folk-songs. The tune-to-tune relationships were discovered
to some degree, as I have indicated, by accident. A spiritual tune would remind
me of a secular one. I would look it up in Sharp or elsewhere, verify the relationship,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
and note it under the proper song in this collection. Such accidents, however,
account for but comparatively few of my related-tune discoveries. In most instances
they came to light as the result of a methodical comparison made possible by my
having catalogued my spiritual folk-tunes and a large number of secular folk-melodies.
I shall not go into a detailed explanation of this cataloguing method
here, chiefly because it is one which, though it answered my own purposes
well, would probably be found inadequate as a tool for students of comparative
melody in general. I shall say merely that the catalog was a card index of tune
beginnings, all transposed to a key which had two flats as its signature. The arrangement
was based on the scale position or relative pitch of the first few
tones. At the beginning of the catalog were those tunes which began on <i>b</i>-flat,
then came those beginning on <i>c</i> and so on. The arrangement among those tunes
beginning on any one tone, followed the same pitch sequence, from lowest to
highest, taking into consideration the second, third, and more notes of the tune
beginnings where necessary. That is, my lexicographical arrangement was like
that of the dictionary, but with notes on a regular staff taking the place of
letters, and with the scale steps taking the place of alphabetical sequence.</p>
<p>The actual working out of this scheme may be observed in the arrangement
of tunes in this collection. In each of the three parts the tunes appear in their
catalog sequence.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Through a consistent comparison of the tunes in this catalog with those in
secular tune files made on the same plan, I have been able to discover the organic
relationship of upwards of 150 melodies in this collection to an even greater
number of traditional folk-tunes associated with <i>secular</i> texts. This greater number
is explained by the fact that one and the same tune in this collection was often
found related to a number of worldly songs. To one tune &lsquo;<a href="#g_Pilgrim">Pilgrim</a>&rsquo;, for example,
I discovered 17 secular related melodies. The relationship runs in degree all the
way from one which is barely recognizable to one which consists in an almost
note-for-note identity.</p>
<p>The catalogs were also of distinct value in bringing to light scores of interrelated
tunes <i>within</i> the collection, and thus in bringing to light the tune families
mentioned on <a class="pgref" href="#Page_14">page 14</a> above.</p>
<p>The search for kindred secular tunes was most fruitful in the case of the ballads
and somewhat less so for the hymns. Among the spiritual songs the search
yielded surprizingly meager results. The reason lay probably in the nature of
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
the spiritual-song tunes themselves. These tunes&mdash;whatever their source&mdash;were
often altered through the arbitrary intrusion of refrains and choruses. Among
these tunes, therefore, my finding of secular analogies was limited usually to
melodic <i>parts</i> instead of whole tunes.</p>
<p>To be sure, the tune relationships, religious to secular, which I have pointed out,
touch little more than half the songs under scrutiny. But when it is taken into
consideration that the related secular tunes were all found in a body of British
Isles-American melodies not much greater than that of the spiritual tunes themselves,
then it would not seem unreasonable to assume that a complete catalog of
American worldly folk-tunes would reveal cognates to many more, possibly to all
of the tunes presented here. The kinships already discovered, however, warrant
the assumption that <i>these spiritual tunes are part and parcel of the ancestral folk-melodism
of the English-speaking peoples</i>.</p>
<p>The worldly-religious tune comparison has also shed more light on the motives
which led the revival folk to borrow from the store of secular melody and on the
manner of that borrowing. We have indicated above our belief that one motive
was the crying need for rousing and familiar tunes. Another reason seems to have
been the mere fact that the borrowed tunes <i>were</i> worldly. Worldliness was of
itself an asset. Fighting the devil with his own weapons had its distinct advantages
in revival technics. But just how and why a <i>particular</i> secular tune came into the
religious atmosphere is not always evident. In some instances, however, the
examination of the secular original song makes this clear.</p>
<p>When the revivalist heard the Scottish-American sing</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Will you go, Lassie, go</p>
<p class="t0">To the braes o&rsquo; Balquhidder?</p>
</div>
<p>he evidently saw at once the possibilities of turning the text to his own evangelistic
purposes, and wasted little time in making it over into &lsquo;Sinner&rsquo;s Invitation:&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sinners go, will you go</p>
<p class="t0">To the highlands of heaven?</p>
</div>
<p>which he sang to the same tune.</p>
<p>The ballad tune to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;Reilly on the rolling sea</p>
<p class="t0">Bound for Amerikee</p>
</div>
<p>went over easily into the song which told of the Christian voyager who was &lsquo;Bound
for Canaan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old ballad &lsquo;Geordie&rsquo; begins</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As I walked over London bridge.</p>
</div>
<p>The revival singers took this hint, with its tune phrase, and produced, in &lsquo;Victoria&rsquo;:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I have but one more river to cross.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>In the traditional ballad &lsquo;In Seaport Town&rsquo; there is a recurring phrase:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Till at last they came to that lonesome valley.</p>
</div>
<p>This &ldquo;valley&rdquo; suggested to the religious mind the emotional depression of the
almost converted mourner as well as the valley of death; and thus came into
existence the beautiful spiritual &lsquo;Lonesome Valley&rsquo;:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">You got to go that lonesome valley,</p>
<p class="t0">You got to go there by yourself</p>
</div>
<p>whose tune is closely related to that of the secular song.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Poor Stranger&rsquo; of the English secular ballad who appeared also as &ldquo;poor
strange girl,&rdquo; a &ldquo;roving soldier,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;rebel soldier,&rdquo; all of whom are &ldquo;far from
my home,&rdquo; exerted both melodic and textual influence on the &lsquo;Heaven-Born
Soldier&rsquo; who urges his comrades to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come along and shout along</p>
<p class="t0">And pray by the way.</p>
</div>
<p>The melody which Johann Sebastian Bach, the great adapter of folk-tunes,
made a peasant sing in his <i>Cantata</i> &lsquo;Mer hahn en neue Oberkeet&rsquo; spread to England
and became there the setting of a number of popular texts in the first half of the
eighteenth century. One of these songs, dating from 1772, was &lsquo;Farewell, Ye
Green Fields and Sweet Groves&rsquo; which gave birth, probably also in England, to
the religious song &lsquo;Green Fields&rsquo;, found in every old southern fasola book. Its
opening lines are</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How tedious and tasteless the hours</p>
<p class="t0">When Jesus no longer I see.</p>
<p class="t0">Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flowers</p>
<p class="t0">Have all lost their sweetness to me.</p>
</div>
<p>With &lsquo;Saw Ye my True Love&rsquo; as a model, the task of making the religious text
&lsquo;Saw Ye My Savior,&rsquo; sung to the same tune, was a grateful one.</p>
<p>The happy inebriate who is his own hero in &lsquo;Way Up On Clinch Mountain&rsquo;
is reformed and regretful in &lsquo;John Adkins&rsquo; Farewell&rsquo; where he gives warning to
other alcoholics in the same melodic strain.</p>
<p>From the above examples it would seem that the secular text contained often
some hint which led the religious adapter in making his new poetic lines; and that
the secular tune usually followed as a matter of course.</p>
<p>The comparison of tunes shed no actually new light on the age of the tunes.
But it made clear the fact that the folk&rsquo;s stock of melodies is assembled from divers
times. The tunes of two songs in this collection, &lsquo;<a href="#g_NewOrleans">New Orleans</a>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<a href="#g_HarkMySoul">Hark my Soul</a>&rsquo;,
have tonal trends strikingly similar to that of melodies found in the eleventh
and early thirteenth centuries respectively. From the early seventeenth century
we find &lsquo;<a href="#g_MournersLamentation">Mourner&rsquo;s Lamentation</a>&rsquo; which was in those earlier times &lsquo;Wae is Me for
Prince Charley&rsquo;, a Jacobite song about Charles II of England. &lsquo;<a href="#g_Beggar">Beggar</a>&rsquo; is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
remake of &lsquo;A-Begging We Will Go&rsquo; which has been traced back to 1611. &lsquo;Captain
Kidd&rsquo; or &lsquo;Kidd&rsquo;, as it is disguised in the fasola books, dates from the first part of
the eighteenth century. It is significant that most of the tunes mentioned in the
above paragraphs are comparatively modern in their musical aspects. This fact
leads to the suspicion that the really old-sounding tunes, those in the antique
modes&mdash;dorian, phrygian, and the like, especially in their gapped forms&mdash;originated
in still earlier times. Here is an inviting field for the student of comparative
folk-melodism.</p>
<h3 id="c15"><i>Conclusion</i></h3>
<p>I have been impressed, as I have come to know these tunes better, with their
variety and beauty. They are believed, by the country folk who still sing them,
to be &ldquo;the most beautiful music on earth.&rdquo; When I first heard this sweeping
judgment I put it down as emanating from an understandable though extravagant
zeal, one which was all the greater perhaps since the singers, mostly oldsters,
felt they were fighting for the very life of a dying cause. But I now see I was
mistaken. The songs are living vigorously without being fought for. The country
folk clearly realized&mdash;however they may have expressed the realisation&mdash;that
the &ldquo;good old songs&rdquo; were ingrained in their racial souls and that for this reason
it was the most completely soul-satisfying of all music from whatever source.</p>
<p>If this was and still is the firm belief of those uncounted thousands who
know and sing the country songs, those who are still carrying on the tradition for
the sheer love of it and the joy they get out of it; then is there not an inspiration
for us? Is that picture not an incentive to look into, to learn to know this <i>tonal
tradition</i>, the chief one in our ethnic background? This quest might well lead
to an examination of our other <i>acquired</i>, not <i>inherited</i>, musical concepts and
judgments, in search for reasons why, in acquiring them, we have ignored the
simpler art of the past. And from this approach we might open the question as
to whether these reasons are valid,&mdash;wise or unwise.</p>
<p>American folk-music, basing squarely on that of the British Isles, is purer, I
assert, and more completely representative of the <i>peoples</i> among whom it has
developed, and less representative of <i>individual</i> creative activity than is the folk-music
of other Western peoples. As evidence of this I present this collection,
commending it to the serious consideration of those interested in fundamental
phases of American culture.</p>
<p>This collection challenges, I feel, the attention also of those interested in the
songs of the churches. Urban congregational singing depends on hymnals. Hymnals
are made by successions of revision committees. These committees have
been either hostile to, or incognisant of, American folk-hymns. The perusal of
almost any protestant hymn-and-tune book will prove this. Thus we have the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
strange anomaly: <i>groups whose prime purpose is to induce more general singing by
the masses, refusing recognition, in their books of songs, to the melodism of those masses
and putting in its place the tonal products of individuals</i>.</p>
<p>There are of late some exceptions to this attitude. In the <i>Christian Science
Hymnal</i>, where one finds numerous folk-tunes from many other lands, there are
two variants of melodies to be found in the present collection, that is, of &lsquo;<a href="#g_Pilgrim">Pilgrim</a>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<a href="#g_Marion">Marion</a>&rsquo;. The editors found these tunes, however, not in America but in the
British Isles.</p>
<p>The Methodists who were, as we have seen, originally largely responsible for
the appearance of folk-tunes in the American religious environment, have for the
past fifty years progressively eliminated them from their authorized hymnals.
But their latest revised edition of 1935 indicates that this tendency has been checked.
I find in that volume seven tunes which are identical with melodies in the present
collection, namely, with &lsquo;<a href="#g_GreenFields">Green Fields</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<a href="#g_NewBritain">New Britain</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<a href="#g_Beloved">Beloved</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<a href="#g_Nettleton">Nettleton</a>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<a href="#g_FriendsOfFreedom">Friends of Freedom</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<a href="#g_Plenary">Plenary</a>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<a href="#g_RomishLady">Romish Lady</a>&rsquo;. There are also five other
tunes in the Hymnal called &ldquo;early American melodies&rdquo; which I have not been
able to identify as folk-melodies.</p>
<p>In England the evangelical protestant hymnal makers seem now to be folk-minded.
The English Methodists, at least, have welcomed into their latest <i>Hymn
Book</i> no less than 43 traditional folk-tunes of the British Isles. They have even
used two tunes&mdash;&lsquo;Rhode Island&rsquo; and &lsquo;<a href="#g_Pisgah">Pisgah</a>&rsquo;&mdash;the latter of which appears in
the present collection, and have called them &ldquo;American&rdquo;, even though one of
them, &lsquo;<a href="#g_Pisgah">Pisgah</a>&rsquo;, came hither from England, as Miss Gilchrist has pointed out.</p>
<p>Then there are the folklorists. How will they greet this collection? My stressing
of tunes and saying little about texts will be regarded by some of the old-line
folklorists&mdash;especially those who still conceive all such material as &ldquo;popular
poetry&rdquo;&mdash;with disapproval. Others, those who are sure that folk-song is dying
out and therefore see the collector&rsquo;s duty simply as that of retrieving the last bits
of it, may greet the present collection as a new acquisition to the museums. Such
a response would arouse in me no enthusiasm and little satisfaction; for I demur
completely from narrow interpretations of the status, meaning, import, and
destiny of folk-lore, folk-songs, <i>these</i> folk-songs. I do not participate in the
pessimism of the folk-song fatalists.</p>
<p>The lore of a folk comprehends, as I understand it, the whole of its basic cultural
accomplishments. Understood in this broadest and deepest sense, a folk-lore is
truer, more vital and more significant than an art-lore. It is a clearer mirror of a
people&rsquo;s past, a more reliable interpreter of its present trends, and a safer prophet
of its culture to come. It is all this because it is the body and soul of that culture,
where art is merely a vestment. The art which fits best this body and soul, this
basic ethnic character, is the best art. The art of ancient Greece was great for this
reason. All students of esthetics since Lessing and Winckelmann have recognized
this. They have recognized also that the great periods in the art of any enduring
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
people are those when its gifted creators are in closest harmony with the genius
of their race; and that its barren periods are those when the masters have been
faithless to their own and have sought afar &ldquo;the good which lies so near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The text&mdash;undoubtedly of Inquisition times origin&mdash;indicates the age of the
ballad. It is to be found in the <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i>, i., 43. It is mentioned in
Beaumont and Fletcher&rsquo;s &ldquo;Knight of the Burning Pestle&rdquo; (1613). A parody on the
opening words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There was a moanish lady</p>
<p class="t0">Lived in a moanish land;</p>
<p class="t0">She had a moanish daughter</p>
<p class="t0">Could moan at the Lord&rsquo;s command <i>etc.</i></p>
</div>
<p>is in Sandburg&rsquo;s <i>American Songbag</i>, p. 11. Another echo of this ballad text is:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Romish Lady, she had babes,</p>
</div>
<p>in &lsquo;The Wife of Usher&rsquo;s Well&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 159. I recorded the tune in Dayton, Virginia;
see <i>White Spirituals</i>, 202. <i>The Methodist Hymnal</i> (1935, No. 436) has a
variant of the tune which it calls a &ldquo;traditional English carol&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A close tune variant is &lsquo;Lost City&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<a href="#g_ToGloryIWillGo">To Glory I Will Go</a>&rsquo; in this collection.
Tune and words are a parody of &lsquo;A-Begging We Will Go&rsquo; which was widely
popular in the latter part of the seventeenth century and traces of whose existence
are found as early as 1611.</p>
<p>See Chappell&rsquo;s <i>Old English Popular Music</i>, ii., 42-43.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The first stanza of the song as it appeared in <i>Choyce Ayres</i> etc., 1676, runs:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There was a jovial beggar,</p>
<p class="t0">He had a wooden leg,</p>
<p class="t0">Lame from his cradle and forced for to beg.</p>
<p class="t0">And a begging we will go, we&rsquo;ll go, we&rsquo;ll go,</p>
<p class="t0">And a begging we will go.</p>
</div>
<p>Other songs for which the early song became the prototype were &lsquo;A Bowling We
Will Go&rsquo;, &lsquo;A Fishing We Will Go&rsquo;, &lsquo;A Hawking We Will Go&rsquo; and &lsquo;A Hunting We
Will Go.&rsquo;</p>

<p><i>The Olive Leaf</i> arranger spoiled the tune&rsquo;s apparent mixolydian purity by changing
the <i>d</i>&rsquo;s to <i>d</i>-sharps. As to title and source the editor says: &ldquo;Reverend James
Axley was one of the pioneer preachers of the Holston Conference, and a very holy,
laborious, and successful minister. I learned this tune and song of Reverend Russell
Reneau, who died in Arkansas during our late unhappy Civil War. Crude as the
song is, I choose to preserve it in memory of Mr. Axley and Mr. Reneau.&rdquo; The
tune is a variant of &lsquo;Christian Warfare&rsquo;, GOS 603. Further information as to the
Reverend James Axley, whose period of activity in the methodist conferences of
Tennessee, Kentucky and other states was during the first decades of the nineteenth
century, may be found in Peter Cartwright&rsquo;s <i>Autobiography</i>, p. 62 and elsewhere.</p>

used hymns (not tunes) by Jesse Mercer, benefactor of Mercer University, who
lived in Powellton, Georgia, in the 1820&rsquo;s. The editor of the <i>Sacred Harp</i> attributes
the tune to M. C. H. Davis, a southern rural. The song is found also UH 27,
HH 83, HOC 113, WP 36, SOC 76, SOH I and CHH 58. The tune is a member
of the &lsquo;Lord Lovel&rsquo; family mentioned in the introduction, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>, and is closely
related to &lsquo;Mermaid&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 291, and to &lsquo;The Broom of Cowdenknows&rsquo;, SMM

<p>The song seems to have been inspired by the fate of one of the &ldquo;forty-niners.&rdquo;

<p>John G. McCurry, compiler of the <i>Social Harp</i>, claims this song and dates it
1851. The tune is identical with that of &lsquo;When Boys Go A-Courting&rsquo;, Sharp,
ii., 206. The &ldquo;drunkard&rdquo; theme may have been the textual source of &lsquo;Way Up On
Clinch Mountain&rsquo;, where, to the same tune, the singer glories in his excesses
including that of whiskey drinking. See Sandburg, 307. Miss Scarbrough has a
negro adoption of the same tune in &lsquo;Noble Skewball&rsquo;; see <i>On the Trail of the
Negro Folk-Song</i>, 63. An English folk-song &lsquo;Sweet England&rsquo; has a variant tune.
See <i>English Folk-Songs for Schools</i>, 46. For an Irish variant see Petrie, No. 1172.
A Scotch variant is &lsquo;My Ain Fireside&rsquo;, <i>Lyric Gems of Scotland</i>, 186, which in turn
borrowed its tune from &lsquo;Todlen Hame&rsquo;.</p>

it, first, at a camp-meeting, North Cove, Burk Co., N. C., in 1831 or 1832. Published

<p>The <i>Sacred Harp</i> says this was &ldquo;composed by H. S. Rees, 1859&rdquo;. Is it perhaps
a parody of Wm. Haines Lytle&rsquo;s &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Dying, Egypt, Dying&rsquo;? Lytle was a cousin
of Stephen Collins Foster whose own song &lsquo;For the Dear Old Flag I Die&rsquo; shows
close kinship in words and tune to &lsquo;Dying Boy&rsquo;. (See my article in <i>The Musical
Quarterly</i>, xxii., No. 2.) There is a resemblance also between the &lsquo;Dying Boy&rsquo; tune
and a seventeenth century psalm tune called variously &lsquo;Bella&rsquo;, &lsquo;Leeds&rsquo;, &lsquo;Needham&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Derby&rsquo;; see <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, Historical ed., London, Clowes,

<p>This song occurs also in <i>Olive Leaf</i>, p. 203, where it is called &ldquo;a Scotch air&rdquo;.
Miss Gilchrist tells us, in the article often cited here, that &lsquo;Saw Ye My Savior&rsquo; is
&lsquo;Saw Ye My Father&rsquo;, or &lsquo;The Grey Cock&rsquo;, found in both Scotch and English
versions. A text is in Herd&rsquo;s collections of 1769 and 1772, and another with the
tune, in Chappell&rsquo;s <i>Popular Music</i>. Chappell&rsquo;s version begins:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Saw you my father, saw you my mother,</p>
<p class="t0">Saw you my true love John?</p>
<p class="t0">He told his only dear that he would soon be here,</p>
<p class="t0">But he to another is gone.</p>
</div>
<p>The melodic phrase above, which coincides with the text &ldquo;Oh ... me&rdquo;, is used
to build up the tune for &lsquo;Simple Ploughboy&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 369. As to the influence of
this impressive text on the crucifixion songs of the negroes, see <i>White Spirituals</i>,
277. Stephen Foster seems to have been influenced by the &lsquo;Saw Ye My Savior&rsquo;
tune or its secular relatives in composing his &lsquo;Old Black Joe&rsquo;. (See my article in
<i>The Musical Quarterly</i>, xxii., No. 2.) For further references as to &lsquo;The Grey

<p>The <i>Sacred Harp</i> ascribes the song to John S. Terry and dates it 1869. Terry
was a singing-school teacher of Georgia and later lived in Alabama. The singing-school
teacher took for his warning song the &lsquo;Lord Lovel&rsquo; tune type that has been
used for many secular ballads. Among them are &lsquo;Barbara Allen&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 195,
tune O; &lsquo;Gypsy Laddie&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 237, tune F; &lsquo;Come all Ye Fair and Tender
Ladies&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 135, tune P. For other tunes of the same type see &lsquo;<a href="#g_Dulcimer">Dulcimer</a>&rsquo;

<p>The text is attributed, by the 1911 editor of the <i>Sacred Harp</i>, to B. F. White,
original compiler of that book. He wrote it &ldquo;on the lone prairie in Texas&rdquo;, while
standing &ldquo;at the grave of a friend who once lived in Georgia&rdquo;. In <i>Folksongs of
Mississippi</i> Hudson gives a variant text from oral tradition and tells of a local
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
legend as to its source which agrees in the main with that given in the <i>Sacred
Harp</i> which book, I suspect, was the source of the Mississippi legend.</p>
<p>The tune, variously claimed in the fasola books, is identical with the &lsquo;Braes o&rsquo;
Balquhidder&rsquo;. See Gilchrist, JFSS, viii., 77. Other derivatives of the same tune
are &lsquo;<a href="#g_SinnersInvitation">Sinner&rsquo;s Invitation</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<a href="#g_Florence">Florence</a>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<a href="#g_OrphanGirl">Orphan Girl</a>&rsquo; in this collection. In <i>The

<p>Tune attributed to J. M. Day, a Georgian. Doubt as to the correctness of this
source is cast by the appearance of both tune and text in the <i>Christian Lyre</i> of 1830,
No. 4. Variants are &lsquo;Invocation&rsquo;, GOS 67, and &lsquo;Lord Revive Us&rsquo;, PB 198. The
<i>Sacred Harp</i> editor evidently looked upon this tune as one in <i>a</i>-minor, whereas
it is probably a dorian melody with <i>f</i>-sharp as its tonic, and should have also a
<i>d</i>-sharp in its key signature.</p>

<p>The tune was recorded, from oral tradition evidently, by William Caldwell (of

of Inverary&rsquo;. Cf. JFSS, viii., 198.</p>
<p>The unique opening melodic phrase is to be found also in &lsquo;Young Beeham&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Ship&rsquo;s Carpenter&rsquo;, Cox 528. Another tune variant in the fasola environment is

<p>The tune is a member of the &lsquo;<a href="#g_RollJordan">Roll Jordan</a>&rsquo; family which is described under the
song by that name in this collection. The &lsquo;Tennessee&rsquo; tune&rsquo;s resemblance to
Foster&rsquo;s &lsquo;Susanna&rsquo; is evident. The melody, or some near relative of it, may well
have furnished Foster with his inspiration in composing the latter. It had been
sung widely in America for at least fifty years before the Pittsburgh composer
published his minstrel song. (See the author&rsquo;s article &lsquo;Stephen Foster&rsquo;s Debt to
American Folk-Song&rsquo;, <i>The Musical Quarterly</i>, xxii., No. 2.)</p>
<p>That the &lsquo;Tennessee&rsquo; tune was &ldquo;unwritten music&rdquo; in the South, and therefore
free for all, is indicated by the many claimants to its authorship; Chapin, J. Robertson,
L. P. Breedlove, William C. Davis, and William Walker were among them.
In various forms and with different texts the tune is found also, CHI 84 (published
in 1805), SKH 23, GCM 134, SOH 28, GOS 229, HOC 114, WP 96, TZ 94,

<p>Recorded from singing of Miss Will Allen Dromgoole, Nashville, Tennessee,
as she remembered it sung in 1890 by Mr. Tate, stage driver from Beersheba to
Beersheba Springs on Cumberland Mountain in Tennessee. The unusual spelling
is an attempt at reproducing the emphatic rhythmic pronunciation of Mr. Tate.
The one stanza given above was all Miss Dromgoole remembered. The full text,
however, was recorded by Mr. Fred Haun of Newport, Tennessee, from the
singing of his mother, Mrs. Maggie Haun, and placed at my disposal by Miss
Mildred Haun, his sister. This rather defective text is as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">Before it was dark she opened the ark</p>
<p class="t0">And found the sweet infant was there.</p>

<p>The above homespun text points to the rural preacher or revival song leader
of the late eighteenth century as its source. It is a conversion story in dramatic
form, the Savior, the Sinner and the Devil having parts in the drama.</p>
<p>The earliest known occurrence of the tune is in the Vermont book, Ingalls&rsquo;
<i>Christian Harmony</i> of 1805, p. 77. In the <i>Sacred Harp</i> of 1844, p. 89, it is found
with a different text and is entitled &lsquo;Church&rsquo;s Desolation&rsquo;. It is claimed there by
J. T. White, and in the <i>Christian Harmony</i> of 1866, by William Walker. Both were
South Carolinians, from which territory Reed Smith recorded the tune in 1913 as
one of the &lsquo;Barbara Allen&rsquo; settings; SCB 130. This tune was probably adopted for
&lsquo;Church&rsquo;s Desolation&rsquo; and for the &lsquo;Barbara Allen&rsquo; ballad from the Scotch ballad
&lsquo;Wae&rsquo;s me for Prince Charlie&rsquo;. See Kennedy&rsquo;s <i>Handbook of Scottish Song</i>, p. 20.
The London <i>Era</i> in the early 1860&rsquo;s speaks of this as the &ldquo;celebrated Jacobite
song.&rdquo; The &lsquo;Prince Charlie&rsquo; of the song is Charles II of England. Hence the song,
the text at least, is nearly 300 years old. The same tune is used also for &lsquo;Geordie&rsquo;,
<i>Last Leaves</i>, p. 133; &lsquo;Locks and Bolts&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 19; &lsquo;Lazarus&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 30;
an old Irish tune in Petrie, No. 363; &lsquo;Johnny Fa&rsquo;&rsquo;, SMM, No. 62; and &lsquo;Hynd
Horn&rsquo;, Motherwell, Appendix, <i>Musick</i>, No. 13.</p>
<p>The noted composer of hymn tunes, J. B. Dykes, was influenced by the &lsquo;Prince
Charlie&rsquo; melody in the building up of &lsquo;Lindisfarne&rsquo;; see <i>Hymns Ancient and
Modern</i>, No. 156, second tune.</p>

<p>William Walker claims this song. See &lsquo;Church&rsquo;s Desolation&rsquo;, a variant of the
tune, for source references. See also &lsquo;Sweet William and Lady Margery&rsquo; (Wyman

<p>The words are attributed to Isaac Watts. I have supplied the second and third

found also OSH 286, PB 38, HH 63, UHH 13. The tune&rsquo;s frame is found with
the text of &lsquo;Good Morning, My Pretty Little Miss&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 90, also in &lsquo;Ibby
Damsel&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 137. I surmise that we have, in the last line of the second

<p>The song is attributed in the <i>Social Harp</i> to Wm. C. Davis. The first stanza
was evidently inspired by the lines in the traditional English ballad entitled &lsquo;Giles
Collins&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 196, which reads:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Look away, look away, that lonesome dove</p>
<p class="t0">That sails from pine to pine;</p>
<p class="t0">It&rsquo;s mourning for its own true love</p>
<p class="t0">Just like I mourn for mine.</p>
</div>
<p>Four recently recorded (1917 and 1918) variants of the &lsquo;Newberry&rsquo; tune, with
one stanza of text each are in Sharp, ii., 197f. See also JAFL, xxv., 276. &lsquo;Lonesome

<p>James, editor of the <i>Original Sacred Harp</i>, 1911, says: &ldquo;The hymn is from a very
old edition, 1820. It is not in any of the hymn books found since that date.&rdquo; The
quick triple time of the tune indicates Irish influence and, probably, source.
Similar is &lsquo;Royal Band&rsquo;, OSH 360.</p>
<p>As to the remarkable rhyme or assonance in the text&mdash;see for example the
repeated &ldquo;o&rdquo; assonance in the first lines&mdash;I am reminded of what Cecil Sharp
said of this feature in Anglo-Irish ballads of this sort, namely, that &ldquo;They imitate
with more or less success in an alien tongue the assonantal Gaelic rhymes with
which their makers, whether hedge-schoolmasters or peasants, were doubtless
familiar.&rdquo; The same metrical trend is in &lsquo;Green Grows the Laurel&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 211.</p>

<p>This is a comparatively recent recording (around the beginning of the present
century) of an extremely widely sung folk-tune. It appears in <i>Good Old Songs</i>
as a bare melody, no harmonic parts. I suggest, as an explanation of the d-flat in the
fifth measure from the end, the intrusion of dorian influence. The earliest known
recording among the fasola folk was in the first edition of the <i>Sacred Harp</i>, 1844.
The negro adoptions and adaptations are reviewed WS 251ff.</p>
<p>The tune is quite evidently borrowed from secular environment. I list here a
number of secular songs whose tunes are variously related: &lsquo;Barbara Allen&rsquo;, Sharp,
i., 194 and 195; &lsquo;In Old Virginny&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 232-234; &lsquo;Come All Ye Fair and
Tender Ladies&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 128-136; &lsquo;Katie Morey&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 120; &lsquo;Dear Companion&rsquo;,
Sharp, ii., 109; &lsquo;George Reilly&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 26; &lsquo;Awake, Awake&rsquo;, Sharp,
i., 358-364, and Petrie, Nos. 1222 and 265.</p>
<p>A note on this song in the <i>Social Harp</i> says that the compiler, John G. McCurry,
Hartwell, Georgia, &ldquo;when eight years old, learned the air of this tune from Mrs.
Catherine Penn.&rdquo; That was therefore in the year 1829.</p>
<p>Text passages in the secular ballads which remind of those in the fasola song
are seen in &lsquo;In Old Virginny&rsquo;, where we read:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I am a man of constant sorrow,</p>
<p class="t0">I have seen troubles all my days.</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll bid farewell to old Virginia,</p>
<p class="t0">The place where I was partly raised.</p>

<p>The tune shows remarkable similarity to &lsquo;As I Was A-Walking&rsquo; or &lsquo;Grenadier
and the Lady&rsquo;, see JFSS viii., 194; also to &lsquo;Westron Wynde&rsquo; from the early 16th
century, see Jackson, <i>English Melodies from the 13th to the 18th Century</i>, p. 11.
&lsquo;Female Convict&rsquo; was widely sung in the early nineteenth century. The full title
reads: &ldquo;A Female Convict, After receiving pardon in the sight of God, thus
addrest her infant. Set to music by R. Boyd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A version of both tune and words is found in Ingalls&rsquo; <i>Christian Harmony</i> of 1805,
p. 73. Its seventh and eighth stanzas, reminding of the above text, are:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When weeping Mary came to seek</p>
<p class="t0">Her Lord with a perfume,</p>
<p class="t0">The napkin and the sheet she found</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The angels said, he is not here;</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;s risen from the dead;</p>
<p class="t0">And streams of grace to sinners flow,</p>
<p class="t0">As free as did his blood.</p>
</div>
<p>The tune shows unmistakable family resemblance to a number of secular folk-melodies.
See for example the score of &lsquo;Daemon Lover&rsquo; tunes, Sharp, i., pp.
244-258; &lsquo;Lady Maisry&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 97; &lsquo;Locks and Bolts&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 17; &lsquo;Betty

<p>The tune was perhaps the inspiration of R. Boyd in making the melody for
&lsquo;<a href="#g_FemaleConvict">Female Convict</a>&rsquo;, which is in this collection. (Or did the influence flow in the

<p>The tune is one of the comparatively few correct dorian recordings&mdash;not
minorized&mdash;in the fasola song books. The compiler of the <i>Olive Leaf</i> gives the
following note below the song: &ldquo;I learned this air of Rev. Samuel Anthony, of
Georgia, more than thirty years ago, Wm. Hauser, M. D., March, 1878.&rdquo; See
Introduction, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>, as to the &lsquo;Babe of Bethlehem&rsquo; tune family to which &lsquo;Happy

<p>The tune, evidently dorian, is of a type that was widely used and varied
by folk singers. I mentioned this type in the Introduction, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_14">page 14</a>, and called it
the &lsquo;Babe of Bethlehem&rsquo; family of tunes because the above seems to have been one
of its best members. Other members, in either the dorian or the aeolian mode,
are &lsquo;<a href="#g_HappySoulsA">Happy Souls (A)</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<a href="#g_Marion">Marion</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<a href="#g_Atonement">Atonement</a>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<a href="#g_Enquirer">Enquirer</a>&rsquo; in this collection;

orally transmitted, is &lsquo;<a href="#g_OImSoHappy">O I&rsquo;m So Happy</a>&rsquo;, in this collection. Another variant here
is &lsquo;<a href="#g_Stephens">Stephens</a>&rsquo;. All these tunes seem to derive from an old one recorded in Kilrush,
Ireland, and found in the Petrie collection in two variants, Nos. 167 and 283. Compare
also the similar &lsquo;<a href="#g_Hallelujah">Hallelujah</a>&rsquo; tune family with its members listed under the
tune by that title in this collection.</p>
<p>The text is by John Leland and was uniquely popular&mdash;as sung in its purity
or associated with various refrains and revival choruses&mdash;during the early part
of the nineteenth century. The negroes have borrowed freely from this poem in
making the texts for their spirituals, especially from the fourth and fifth stanzas.

<p>The tune is to be found in S. Baring-Gould&rsquo;s <i>Songs of the West</i>, No. 100, as
recorded before 1890 from the singing of an old man in Lamerton, England.
We are informed by the editor of the collection that the song, &lsquo;Both Sexes Give
Ear to My Fancy&rsquo; which used this tune, had been very popular with aged people
residing in the North of England, but that it was then &ldquo;long out of print and
handed down traditionally&rdquo;. The earliest form of the tune seems to have been
&lsquo;Es nehme zehn-tausend Ducaten&rsquo; in Johann Sebastian Bach&rsquo;s cantata <i>Mer
hahn en neue Oberkeet</i> (Cf. Bach-Gesellschaft, Vol. 29, p. 195). The earliest
printed form of the Bach tune in England, according to Baring-Gould, was in
<i>The Tragedy of Tragedies</i>, or <i>Tom Thumb</i>, 1734, as the setting of the song &lsquo;In
Hurry Posthaste for a License&rsquo;. The earliest occurrence of the tune with the
&lsquo;Both Sexes&rsquo; text was in <i>The Lady&rsquo;s Evening Book of Pleasure</i>, about 1740. The
air is also found in <i>Vocal Music, or the Songster&rsquo;s Companion</i>, second edition, 1782,
to the song entitled &lsquo;Farewell, Ye Green Fields and Sweet Groves&rsquo;. This was
probably the song whose tune was taken over bodily and whose words were
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
parodied to make the above song &lsquo;Green Fields&rsquo;. The author of the parody text
was sometimes given in the fasola books as John Newton. The incidence of the
song in southern song books of the first half of the nineteenth century (MOH 52,
GCM 144, UH 112, KNH 80, OSH 127, HH 345, SOC 30, CM 24, HOC 16,
TZ 237, SKH 18, PB 312, GOS 303, etc.) indicates its one-time wide popularity
also on this continent.</p>

antiquity of this tune form is given by the &lsquo;Ass&rsquo;s Sequence&rsquo; or &lsquo;Orientis partibus&rsquo;
from the beginning of the thirteenth century, a tune which was apparently cast
in the folk-manner of that age.</p>

<p>The text has been attributed to Watts. Recent hymnals have been purged of this
doleful ditty and of all other songs which make hellfire too realistic. The tune was
attributed to Chapin in some books and to Davisson in others. Davisson claims
it in his <i>Kentucky Harmony</i> (1815). It is practically identical with &lsquo;Little Musgrave
and Lady Barnard&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 182, a tune which Sharp heard in Greenwood,
Albemarle County, Virginia, Davisson&rsquo;s own territory and near where he is buried.
An early variant which is practically identical with both the Sharp and the Davisson
tunes is in Motherwell, Supplement, No. 30, associated with &lsquo;The Bonnie Mermaid&rsquo;
text. Found also, KYH 43, SOH 119, UH 37, KNH 38, OSH 29, HH 55.</p>

<p>The song is found also, SOH (1854) 252, GOS 436, PB 384, OL 371, and in
various tune books of the Baptists up to the present time. The <i>Southern Harmony</i>
attributes the tune to &ldquo;Christopher&rdquo;; <i>Good Old Songs</i>, to &ldquo;J. Christopher&rdquo;; and
the <i>Hesperian Harp</i> attributes the words to the &ldquo;Rev. Alex Means, A. M., M. D.,
D. D., LL. D.&rdquo;, a Methodist minister of Oxford, Ga. It looks as though tune and
words were born together, so beautifully they fit. The stanzaic form is that of the
&lsquo;Captain Kidd&rsquo; ballad which has been widely sung and parodied since the beginning
of the eighteenth century. A spiritual song tune related to &lsquo;Wondrous
Love&rsquo; is &lsquo;<a href="#g_Villulia">Villulia</a>&rsquo; in this collection. I have heard the country folk sing this tune
with the dorian raised sixth.</p>

<p>The tune is evidently a remake of &lsquo;Locks and Bolts&rsquo;. Compare, for example,
Sharp, ii., 19. The difference between the two tunes is probably due in part to
their structure, which provided real difficulties for their recorders, and in part
to the efforts of the <i>Bible Songs</i> arranger to make the apparently dorian tune fit
into current scale formulas. Compare also &lsquo;Bed of Primroses&rsquo;, Thomas, p. 176.</p>

<p>The words were quite evidently made to go with the celebration of the footwashing
rite still observed by the Primitive Baptists, from whose hymn book the
song is taken. The tune is ascribed to L. P. Breedlove of Georgia. I find it to
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
be a close variant of &lsquo;James Harris&rsquo; (or &lsquo;Daemon Lover&rsquo; or &lsquo;House Carpenter&rsquo;)
turned around; that is, with the second part of the above tune coming first in the
secular ballad tune. For versions of the &lsquo;James Harris&rsquo; tune see Thomas 172,
Davis 592-594, Cox 524, and Sharp, i., 244-258. The oldest variant tune known
to me is that in Motherwell associated with &lsquo;Blue Flowers and Yellow&rsquo; (Appendix,
<i>Musick</i>, No. 17.) After comparing the above tune with its worldly relatives, it
becomes evident that the GOS signature of <i>b</i>-flat should be changed to that of
<i>f</i>-natural, raising the sixth and restoring what was evidently a dorian tune.</p>

<p>Echoes of &lsquo;Turkey in the Straw&rsquo; (see Sandburg, p. 94) are heard in this tune.
Compare also &lsquo;My Grandma Lived on Yonder Little Green&rsquo;, WS 166. The immediate
ancestor of the tune, and the source of its title, is the secular song &lsquo;A Rose-Tree
in Full Bearing&rsquo;, <i>The English Musical Repository</i>, Edinburgh, 1811, p. 127.
It appeared in William Shield&rsquo;s ballad opera &lsquo;The Poor Soldier&rsquo;, 1783. The
&lsquo;Rose Tree&rsquo; air was known in Ireland also as &lsquo;Moreen O&rsquo;Cullenan&rsquo; and was associated,
among other texts, with Moore&rsquo;s &lsquo;I&rsquo;d Mourn the Hopes that Leave Us&rsquo;.

<p>Tune found also in CHI 12, KNH 109, UH 63, SOC 168, HH 28, SKH 47,
GOS 26. The text, taken from the <i>Dover Selection</i>, as well as the tune, attributed
to &lsquo;Chapin&rsquo;, seem to be closely related to a Christmas carol in JFSS, ii., 115.
Its first stanza begins: &ldquo;Come all ye faithful Christians, That dwell within this
land. That pass your time in rioting, Remember you are but man.&rdquo; The English
folk-song, &lsquo;Just as the Tide Was a-Flowing&rsquo;, has an almost identical tune. See

</div>
<p>Four more stanzas in the <i>Southern Harmony</i>. Found also GOS 218, CHH 208.
William Walker, compiler of the <i>Southern Harmony</i>, appends the note: &ldquo;This song
was composed by the author in the fall of 1831, while traveling over the mountains,
on French Broad River, in North Carolina and Tennessee&rdquo;. Walker must have
been referring simply to the words. He was melodizing, probably unconsciously,
in beaten paths. For his tune is almost identical with the older &lsquo;<a href="#g_Kedron">Kedron</a>&rsquo; (this
collection) which was attributed to &ldquo;Dare&rdquo;. Walker declares, in his later song
book, <i>Christian Harmony</i>, 1866, p. 208, that he &ldquo;learned the air of this tune from
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
my mother when only five years old.&rdquo; That would have been 1814. Both the Dare
and the Walker tunes are closely related to the melody of &lsquo;McAfee&rsquo;s Confession&rsquo;,
Sharp, ii., 16, lower tune, a western North Carolina recording of 1918; and to the
Old World song, &lsquo;The Wraggle Taggle Gipsies O&rsquo;, <i>One Hundred English Folk-Songs</i>,

<p>The poem is by Joseph Grigg (b. 1720). Ananias Davisson of the Valley of
Virginia named and claimed the tune in his <i>Kentucky Harmony</i> (1815). Annabel
Morris Buchanan has found a tune with the title &lsquo;Retirement&rsquo; in a manuscript tune
book which she judges to be from the eighteenth century. No text accompanies
the tune, and no source is given. It follows:</p>

<br /><a class="small ab" href="images/p054d.mid">play</a></div>
<p>A comparison of the two tunes indicates rather plainly that Davisson wrote
the tune down from oral tradition, and that his noting was indicative of the
manner in which it was actually sung.</p>

<p>The compiler of the <i>Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony</i> attributed the song
to &ldquo;Bradshaw&rdquo;. I find distinct ancestral traces of its tune in &lsquo;Princess Royal&rsquo;
given in a number of traditional forms as a morris dance tune in Sharp, <i>The Morris
Dance Book</i>. Assuming these to be the oldest forms of the tune, the next younger
form seems to have been what was called in Walsh&rsquo;s <i>Compleat Dancing Master</i>
(<i>ca.</i> 1730), &ldquo;The Princess Royal, the new way&rdquo;. In 1796 Shield adapted the
air to the words of &lsquo;The Saucy Arethusa&rsquo; in the ballad opera <i>The Lock and Key</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
It may be found entitled &lsquo;The Arethusa&rsquo; in <i>The English Musical Repository</i>, p. 32.
At about the same time&mdash;around the end of the eighteenth century&mdash;the tune
was used also for &lsquo;Bold Nelson&rsquo;s Praise&rsquo; a version of which was recently recorded
by Sharp, <i>One Hundred English Folk-Songs</i>, No. 88. The as yet unidentified
&ldquo;Bradshaw&rdquo; seems to have taken one of these late-eighteenth-century tunes&mdash;probably
&lsquo;Arethusa&rsquo;&mdash;as his model when he made the &lsquo;Mississippi&rsquo; song as it
appeared in the <i>Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony</i> in 1820.</p>

<p>The <i>Hesperian Harp</i> gives the tune as an &ldquo;Irish Air&rdquo;. We recognize it as the
melody to which &lsquo;Believe Me, If all Those Endearing Young Charms&rsquo; is sung
universally. Woolridge tells us it is the setting for the popular ballad &lsquo;My Lodging,
It is on the Cold Ground&rsquo; as printed &ldquo;on all broadsides, with music, of the last
century&rdquo;, meaning the eighteenth century. The ballad, in connection with a
different tune, had been popular from around the middle of the seventeenth
century in England. With the above tune its singing vogue seems not even yet to
have abated. See Chappell&rsquo;s <i>Old English Popular Music</i>, ii., 137ff. An old Irish
version of the tune is &lsquo;Oh Shrive me Father&rsquo;, Petrie, No. 632. Stephen Foster
undoubtedly had this popular tune formula in mind when he composed &lsquo;Old Folks
at Home&rsquo;. See <i>Musical Quarterly</i>, vol. xxii., No. 2, pp. 158-160.</p>

<p>Four more stanzas of the text are given in the <i>Revivalist</i>. The tune was recorded
&ldquo;as sung by Rev. A. C. Rose&rdquo; from whom it got its title. The oldest recording
of the melody known to me is on page 38 of Ingalls&rsquo; <i>Christian Harmony</i>,
1805. The Reverend Rose&rsquo;s song appears in this collection also as &lsquo;<a href="#g_OTellMeNoMore">O Tell Me No More</a>&rsquo;,
in its standardized tune-book form, whereas the recorder of the above
variant has caught much of the folk-singing manner. Both of the tunes in question
are related to the &lsquo;Lord Randal&rsquo; melodies which are found in Sharp, i., 43, G.</p>

It is a variant also of &lsquo;Lord Bateman&rsquo;, Sharp, <i>One Hundred English Folk-songs</i>,

Hame, Hame&rsquo;, a Jacobite song whose words tell of a Scotch exile and his longing
for home. The editor of that collection found it in the <i>Garland of Scotia</i>. The old

<p>Seaborn M. Denson composed this tune as a setting to Charles Wesley&rsquo;s text
and inserted it, in a fuguing-tune setting, in the <i>Original Sacred Harp</i> of 1911.
The tune is testimony to the fact that its composer was steeped in the traditional
Anglo-American folk-melodism and in that particular direction which it took in
the hands of the eighteenth century fuguing-song makers. Compare for melodic
similarities &lsquo;Geordie&rsquo;, JFSS, iii., 191. <i>White Spirituals</i> tells more about Mr.
Denson who died in 1936.</p>

<p>William Hauser, compiler of the <i>Olive Leaf</i> tells that this &ldquo;air [was] learned of
Reverend Samuel Anthony, of Georgia, in 1841.&rdquo; The tune of a Virginia version
of the &lsquo;Brown Girl&rsquo; (Sharp, i., 303) is very close to this in note-trend and character.
Also &lsquo;Pretty Saro&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 10-12; &lsquo;Cuckoo&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 180; &lsquo;Green Bushes&rsquo;,
Sharp, ii., 155; &lsquo;Farewell, Dear Rosanna&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 243 and 244, are the same
type. Negro adoptions of the tune are Marsh, pp. 144 and 173, and SS, p. 33.
A variant in this collection is &lsquo;<a href="#g_RestInHeaven">Rest in Heaven</a>&rsquo;. For its relationship to the &lsquo;<a href="#g_IWillArise">I Will Arise</a>&rsquo;
tune family, see the song with that title in this collection. The errors in
Hauser&rsquo;s notation of the tune (second, fourth, sixth measures etc.) have been left

<p>The text is attributed to &ldquo;John Gambold, of England.&rdquo; I find the tune to be a
relative of a &lsquo;Lord Randal&rsquo; variant which Sharp (i., 43, G) found in eastern Tennessee.
The resemblance of the two tunes runs throughout; but in the last four-measure
phrase (going with the worldly sentence &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick to the heart and I
fain would lie down&rdquo;) they are practically identical. &lsquo;<a href="#g_Rose">Rose</a>&rsquo; in this collection is a

<p>The <i>Southern Harmony</i> gives the maker of this song as I. Neighbours, who may
indeed have been the author of the text. This text is clearly a parody, and the
tune a close variant, of &lsquo;When the Stormy Winds do Blow&rsquo; or &lsquo;You Gentlemen of
England&rsquo;, a song of seafaring which appears to have been widely sung in England
over a long period. References to a &lsquo;Stormy Winds&rsquo; ballad reach back to 1660.

Among its related secular tunes are &lsquo;Greenwood Siding&rsquo; (&lsquo;Cruel Mother&rsquo;), Cox,
p. 522; an unnamed tune in Petrie, No. 193; &lsquo;Oh Love it is a Killing Thing&rsquo;,
Petrie, No. 469; and &lsquo;When First I left Old Ireland&rsquo;, Petrie, No. 863. A remarkable
tune resemblance and one which opens to the imagination surprising vistas as to
the possible age of the &lsquo;New Orleans&rsquo; tune, is to be seen in the Whitsuntide church
melody &lsquo;Iam Christus astra ascenderat&rsquo; from the eleventh century:</p>

<p>The tune is ascribed to Nicholson. The oldest American recording known to
me is in the four-shape-note manuscript song collection made by Catherine
Alderice in or near Emmittsburg, Md., 1800-1830, p. 37. Miss Gilchrist calls
attention to the secular &lsquo;Captain Kidd&rsquo; ballad, of which the above is a parody, as
it appeared, twenty-five verses long, in <i>Our Familiar Songs and Who Made Them</i>,
published in America, 1889. She describes it as &ldquo;a sort of dying speech and testament
probably dating from about 1701 in which year Kidd and nine of his associates
were hanged in Execution Dock.... There were many other eighteenth
century songs, built on this peculiar stanzaic plan, celebrating other notorious
characters, &lsquo;Admiral Benbow,&rsquo; &lsquo;Jack (or Sam) Hall.&rsquo;&rdquo; Other American spiritual
songs in this collection having the same stanzaic form are &lsquo;<a href="#g_WondrousLove">Wondrous Love</a>&rsquo; and

<p>The mood of the poem indicates a considerable age for it. That the song as a
whole was decidedly among the stock of orally transmitted ones is indicated by the
many claimants to its authorship. Such claimants in the southern books are
F. Price, William Caldwell, James Carrell and Ananias Davisson. Found also,
UH 56, KNH 108, HH 225, SKH 66, CHH 361. The stanzaic form is that of
&lsquo;<a href="#g_CaptainKidd">Captain Kidd</a>&rsquo; in this collection. In his <i>Christian Harmony</i>, William Walker adds
the note that &ldquo;I learned it [the tune] from my dear mother (who now sings in
heaven) when I was only three years old,&mdash;the first tune I ever learned.&rdquo; That
was in 1812. That the song was even older, however, is shown by its appearance
in Ingalls&rsquo; <i>Christian Harmony</i> of 1805, p. 39.</p>

<p>The text is attributed to Benjamin Beddome, and the tune to Joseph Barnby, and
to E. J. King. The first, sixth, and seventh measures had only quarter notes in the
<i>Sacred Harp</i>. The slurred eighth notes are inserted from a variant of the tune
found in the <i>Olive Leaf</i>. They represent probably an effort on the part of the
editor of that song book to present the tune as really sung.</p>

<p>Recorded by the author, September 21, 1932, in Nashville, Tennessee, from the
singing of Samuel E. Asbury who learned it from hearing it sung at camp
meetings in western North Carolina in the 1880&rsquo;s. The tune is quite evidently an
orally transmitted version of that of &lsquo;<a href="#g_FaithfulSoldier">Faithful Soldier</a>&rsquo;, in this collection, which
first appeared in the <i>Southern Harmony</i> (1835) and was claimed by William Walker,
the compiler of that collection. See also &lsquo;<a href="#g_Hallelujah">Hallelujah</a>&rsquo; in this collection, a type tune to
which the above melody is organically related, for further data as to kindred tunes.</p>

<p>Recorded by the compiler of this collection from the singing of Francis Arthur
Robinson, Nashville, Tennessee, as he had heard it in the backwoods of Wayne
County, Tennessee, in 1926. Mr. Robinson called it a &ldquo;barefoot white&rdquo; song.
The tied notes are sung in a skid or scoop. Subsequent stanzas:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Left his pappy to moan, moan, <i>etc.</i></p>
<p class="t0">Left his widder alone, lone, <i>etc.</i></p>
<p class="t0">Left his mammy to weep, weep, <i>etc.</i></p>
</div>
<p>and many more. In <i>The Carolina Low-Country</i>, page 249, a version of the song
is given as sung by a negro congregation in Beaufort, South Carolina.</p>
<p>This song is one of the most primitive in the present collection. It is valuable,
however, in that it exemplifies well a lyric level which suited both whites and
blacks of a certain cultural status.</p>

the &lsquo;Come to Jesus&rsquo; tune and words. The second part of the German melody is

<p>There are four more stanzas. The song is found also in KNH 52. Both Walker,
compiler of the <i>Southern Harmony</i>, and Davisson, compiler of the <i>Kentucky
Harmony</i>, laid claim to its authorship.</p>
<p>They were doubtlessly both recorders of this same piece of unwritten music.
That was in the 1830&rsquo;s. See the first phrase of &lsquo;Glorishears&rsquo; (Sharp, <i>Morris Dances</i>
Set 5, No. 6) for melodic similarities. The above song, both tune and words,
inspired the composition of &lsquo;<a href="#g_ChristiansHope">Christian&rsquo;s Hope</a>&rsquo; in this collection. A negro remake

<p>The <i>Sacred Harp</i>, edition of 1911, has the following note: &ldquo;H. A. Parris, who
composed the words and music to the &lsquo;Christian&rsquo;s Hope&rsquo;, resides at this time, 1911,
at Helicon, Alabama. He is a great lover of the old <i>Sacred Harp</i> tunes.&rdquo; Mr.
Parris composed the song by assembling, happily withal, wandering distichs and
melodic phrases from songs of much older times. His chief source, both tonally
and textually, was &lsquo;<a href="#g_ChristianProspect">Christian Prospect</a>&rsquo; in this collection. I have been told that
this spiritual grips the <i>Sacred Harp</i> singers&rsquo; emotions so deeply that they can

<p>The poem is by Joseph Swain of England (1762-1796). The tune is attributed
to Freeman Lewis whom Tillett calls merely &ldquo;an American musician.&rdquo; His dates
are 1780-1859. Found also GCM 65, <i>Baptist Hymnal</i> (1902), No. 389. <i>Methodist
Hymnal</i> (1905), No. 530; GOS 102, SOH 15. Miss Gilchrist (<i>op. cit.</i>) compares
this tune with &lsquo;Fair Rosie Ann&rsquo; in Greig&rsquo;s <i>Last Leaves of Traditional Ballads</i>,
p. 771. The chorus of &lsquo;The Sinking of the Titanic&rsquo; a phonograph-recorded song
of wide popularity in America during the 1920&rsquo;s, is practically the same melodic
trend as that of &lsquo;Dulcimer&rsquo;. Its text is:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It was bad when that great ship went down,</p>
<p class="t0">It was bad when that great ship went down,</p>

<p class="t0">Little child&rsquo;en lost their lives,</p>
<p class="t0">It was bad when that great ship went down.</p>
</div>
<p>A song curiously similar to the &lsquo;Titanic&rsquo; song is in <i>The Carolina Low-Country</i>,
page 296, as sung by the negroes on the Santee River in South Carolina. The
tune is changed but little. The words are:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It was sad w&rsquo;en duh grabe sinkin&rsquo; down,</p>
<p class="t0">It was sad w&rsquo;en duh grabe sinkin&rsquo; down,</p>

<p class="t0">People keep awake all night,</p>
<p class="t0">It was sad w&rsquo;en duh grabe sinkin&rsquo; down.</p>
</div>
<p>The tune of &lsquo;Dulcimer&rsquo; is of the &lsquo;Lord Lovel&rsquo; type mentioned in the Introduction,

<p>This song bears the date 1859 and the composer&rsquo;s name, John P. Rees. But
beside the title we read: &ldquo;As sung by Judge Falkerner of Ala.&rdquo; We may therefore
conclude that Rees recorded on that date this older tune from the singing of the
Alabama magistrate. Melodic similarities are seen in &lsquo;Trooper and the Maid&rsquo;,
Sharp, i., 305. A recent negro version from Beaufort, S. C., is in <i>The Carolina
Low-Country</i>, p. 250.</p>

<p>There are three more stanzas of this hymn, the core of which is attributed to
Daniel Medley &ldquo;about 1784.&rdquo; The tune first appeared in the <i>Social Harp</i>, 1855,
where it is attributed to F. C. Wood, a Georgian. A tune and text variant is &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
Go On&rsquo;, REV 252. A negro version of this spiritual may be seen in Dett, 195.
See also <i>White Spirituals</i>, 259. &lsquo;Antioch&rsquo; looks like a make-over from &lsquo;<a href="#g_Columbus">Columbus</a>&rsquo;
in this collection. The tune is cleverly fitted also to a worldly ballad &lsquo;Edward&rsquo;,
found in eastern Tennessee; see Sharp, i., 47. It is found also fitted to the worldly
ballad &lsquo;Cruel Mother&rsquo; in North Carolina; see Sharp, i., 58. &lsquo;Little Musgrave and
Lady Barnard&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 162, shows definite influence of &lsquo;Antioch&rsquo;. See also for
melodic similarities &lsquo;Trooper and the Maid&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 305; and &lsquo;Bridle and Saddle&rsquo;,

<p>John G. McCurry places his name as composer at the top of the page where
this song is found in the <i>Social Harp</i> and dates it 1852. A note at the bottom
says: &ldquo;This tune was arranged as sung by William Bowers, Eagle Grove,
Georgia.&rdquo; Eagle Grove is a few miles south of Hartwell. The tune is a clear
borrowing from &lsquo;Wearing of the Green&rsquo;. See also &lsquo;Our Goodman&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 269,

<p>The text is probably a parody of &lsquo;Rebel Soldier&rsquo; or &lsquo;Poor Stranger&rsquo;, Sharp, ii.,

resemblances. The secular refrain runs:</p>
<div class="verse">

<p>The cowboys, too, made use of the &lsquo;Rebel Soldier&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mourning Pilgrim&rsquo; in the

<p>Seaborn M. Denson, widely known fasola country singing-school teacher and
musical editor of the 1911 edition of the <i>Original Sacred Harp</i>, and author of
this song, told me he had heard this song sung in camp meetings around Civil
War times in northern Alabama. He recorded it from memory and published it
first in the <i>Union Harp</i> in 1909. The tune is a member of the &lsquo;<a href="#g_RollJordan">Roll Jordan</a>&rsquo;
group. See Introduction, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_14">page 14</a>, and the song by that name in this collection.
Further stanzas read &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s gone&rdquo;, &ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s gone&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>The wide spread of this song in the American oral tradition and especially at
the time when Mr. Denson heard it in northern Alabama, is indicated by the variant
and musically somewhat inferior recording in the <i>Revivalist</i>, Albany, New York,
1868. It is there called &lsquo;Away over Jordan&rsquo;. It runs:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My brother&rsquo;s going to wear that crown <i>etc.</i></p>
<p class="t0">To wear that starry crown.</p>

<p>Charles Wesley wrote the text. According to Lightwood, p. 132, it is a parody
on a popular secular song which celebrated Admiral Vernon&rsquo;s return to England
after taking Portobello in 1739. Its first stanza is:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He comes! He comes! The hero comes!</p>
<p class="t0">Sound your trumpets, beat your drums!</p>
<p class="t0">From port to port let cannons roar</p>

<p>It is found also in SOC, published in 1855. In the Introduction <a class="pgref" href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>, I have
mentioned the &lsquo;Roll Jordan&rsquo; type of melody; it was named after the above tune.

<p>Of the author, the editor of the OSH says: &ldquo;Peter Cartwright [the presumptive
author of tune and words] was a minister of the gospel, and used this tune in his
camp meetings long before it was ever placed in notation.&mdash;Peter Cartwright was
born in Amherst County, Va., 1785, and died in Sangamond [sic] County, Ill.,
1872.&rdquo; The song has been widely sung by the negroes who have added numerous
stanzas. See <i>White Spirituals</i>, 263. A pre-Civil War secular negroid parody
on &lsquo;Hebrew Children&rsquo; was published by C. Bradlee &amp; Co., Boston, 1844. Its first
stanza is:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O whar is de spot dat we was born on, (<i>three times</i>)</p>
<p class="t0">Way down in Car&rsquo;line State.</p>

<p>The misfit of words and notes in the first part of the song is quite evident. The

<p>The words, given more fully under &lsquo;Jordan&rsquo;, are Samuel Stenett&rsquo;s. The <i>Sacred

variety. A close melodic relative is &lsquo;O How I love Jesus&rsquo;, REV 456. It will be
seen as akin to &lsquo;Merrily we Roll Along&rsquo;. The tune as adopted by the negroes is

<p>The noting of this tune, evidently from oral tradition, will be seen as quite
faulty. A close variant of the song was found by Miss Gilchrist in the <i>Wesleyan

Davis, p. 570, is similar throughout to this tune. A negro version is in
Marsh, p. 140, under the same title. The compilers of <i>Slave Songs</i> rejected a song
called &lsquo;Give Me Jesus&rsquo; as &ldquo;spurious&rdquo;, that is, as being of white origin. (See

<p>How old the American versions of the &lsquo;Ship of Zion&rsquo; songs are I have not been
able to learn. Newman I. White points to versions in the 1820&rsquo;s (<i>American Negro
Folk-Songs</i>, p. 94).</p>
<p>An early use of the same allegory in religious song is seen in the German folksong
collection of Erk and B&ouml;hme, <i>Deutschyer Liederhort</i>, vol. iii., p. 628f. I find no
melodic similarities between the German and the American songs; but the texts
show remarkable parallels. To make this clear I shall cite a few of the German
stanzas, comparing with them passages taken from various &ldquo;ship&rdquo; songs as sung
by whites and blacks in America.</p>

<p>The tune as it stands is heptatonic dorian. And that is probably a correct notation.
The interesting thing is the device employed to legitimize the dorian
raised sixth, namely, the device of modulation. The writer of the tune, knowing
presumably nothing about the old modes, set his first melodic phrase in <i>g</i>-major
with a semi-cadence on two of the scale. All went well because the <i>f</i>-sharp of
<i>that</i> key was not represented. But in the second part of the tune the actual <i>f</i>-natural
appeared; and the only way he saw of handling it was to change the signature to
a &ldquo;natural key chorus&rdquo; as he specifically calls it. And the final note in the tune
agreed with the key which he took to be <i>a</i>-minor.</p>

<p>Recorded by the author, February 11, 1933, from the singing of Don West of
the Highlander Folk School, Monteagle, Tennessee. Mr. West told me that the
two subsequent stanzas began, &ldquo;You got to lie in that lonesome graveyard&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Some folks say that John was a Baptist.&rdquo; After each verse the tune is repeated
to the words of the first stanza.</p>
<p>The source of this spiritual song is very likely &lsquo;In Seaport Town&rsquo;, see Sharp,
i., 310, in which there is the recurring phrase:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Till at last they came to a lonesome valley,</p>
</div>
<p>and where considerable melodic similarity is to be found. Further traces of this
typical folk-tune are in &lsquo;Young Beichan&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 79; &lsquo;My Mother Bid Me&rsquo;,
Sharp, ii., 94, tune D; &lsquo;Opossum&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 353; &lsquo;Drivin&rsquo; Steel&rsquo;, Sandburg,
p. 150; the negro song &lsquo;You Got to Cross it for Yourself&rsquo;, Sandburg, p. 486;
and &lsquo;That Lonesome Valley&rsquo;, Grissom, p. 2.</p>
<p>In <i>The Carolina Low-Country</i>, pp. 284ff., there are two negro spirituals which
lean heavily on &lsquo;That Lonesome Valley&rsquo;. The &ldquo;lonesome valley&rdquo; symbolized,
among both negroes and whites, also the mourning period which was a necessary
forerunner of religious conversion.</p>

<p>Further stanzas of the text are given under &lsquo;<a href="#g_GoldenHarp">Golden Harp</a>&rsquo;. A variant of this
tune is &lsquo;<a href="#g_Promise">Promise</a>&rsquo; in this collection. &lsquo;<a href="#g_Antioch">Antioch</a>&rsquo; in this collection, is also related.
The tune &lsquo;Service of the Lord&rsquo; or &lsquo;Antioch&rsquo; seems to have been borrowed by
those who sang &lsquo;Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard&rsquo; as it is found in Sharp, i., 162.
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
Indications that the direction of borrowing was as suggested may be found in the
misfit of words to tune in the secular song. See for example where the &ldquo;ar-my&rdquo;
of the above tune and the &ldquo;-lu-jah&rdquo; of &lsquo;Antioch&rsquo; correspond to a mere repetition,
&ldquo;all, all&rdquo;, in the &lsquo;Little Musgrave&rsquo; song. &lsquo;Cruel Mother&rsquo;, Sharp, i., 61, tune K,
is also closely related to &lsquo;Service of the Lord&rsquo;. For negro adoptions and adaptations
see Grissom, p. 60; Marsh, p. 169; <i>White Spirituals</i>, pp. 266 and 267; and Dett,

<p>The text is given more fully under &lsquo;River of Jordan&rsquo;. The song is ascribed by
the compiler of the <i>Social Harp</i> to Henry F. Chandler and dated 1854. The tune
has evidently been used for the worldly ballad &lsquo;Cruel Mother&rsquo;, see Sharp, i., 61.
The chorus reappears in the <i>Wesleyan Psalmist</i> (1842) attached to a text which
begins:</p>

<p>This text by Charles Wesley, supplemented by the infectious chorus and sung
to this swingful tune, was widely popular in the first part of the nineteenth century.
It is given more fully under &lsquo;Pleasant Hill&rsquo;. The song is found, SOH 107 and
HH 102.</p>
<p>The tune had qualities which made it widely popular. There is of course no
knowing whether the many variant forms which I have found derive from the
above tune; but I have given them collectively the name the &lsquo;Hallelujah&rsquo; tune
family. Other members of the family in this collection are &lsquo;<a href="#g_Stephens">Stephens</a>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<a href="#g_PilgrimsTriumph">Pilgrim&rsquo;s Triumph</a>&rsquo;,

<p>James, editor of the 1911 <i>Original Sacred Harp</i>, says that &lsquo;Joyful&rsquo; was composed
by Rev. Abraham D. Merrell. He was born in New Hampshire 1796 and died
in 1878. The first lines of a widely sung parody of this song (or is the above the
parody?) are:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The man who has plenty of good peanuts</p>

</div>
<p>Another, known to Miss Gilchrist, was &lsquo;Three Little Kittens&rsquo;, (See JFSS, viii, 86).
I also heard this song as a nursery ditty in my early youth in Monson, Maine,
in the 1880&rsquo;s. Compare &lsquo;<a href="#g_JudgmentScenes">Judgment Scenes</a>&rsquo; in this collection. The tune was used

</div>
<p>I recorded this song from the singing of Donald Davidson, Vanderbilt University,
June, 1935. Joseph Hart published this poem in 1759. The refrain text
is probably of camp-meeting origin. The tune has been immensely popular for certainly
more than a hundred years in the South. Found also SOH 5, HH 217, WP 25,
PB 342, OSH 312 (tune with other words), OSH 81 (words with another tune).</p>
<p>The tune is typical of a traditional trend. Many other songs show either close
relationship throughout or use single phrases of this melody. The tunes in this
collection which are close to the &lsquo;I Will Arise&rsquo; type (mentioned in the Introduction,
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>) are &lsquo;<a href="#g_HumblePenitent">Humble Penitent</a>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<a href="#g_BeGoneUnbelief">Be Gone Unbelief</a>&rsquo;. Others making use of the second
phrase only, marked <i>a</i>, are &lsquo;<a href="#g_Bozrah">Bozrah</a>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<a href="#g_NewOrleans">New Orleans</a>&rsquo;. A secular tune in the &lsquo;I
Will Arise&rsquo; form is &lsquo;The Bird Song&rsquo;, Sharp, ii., 304; and among the secular tunes
employing phrase <i>a</i> as their tune beginnings are &lsquo;Oh Love It is a Killing Thing&rsquo;
and &lsquo;When I first Left Old Ireland&rsquo;, Petrie, Nos. 469 and 863; and &lsquo;The Cruel
Mother&rsquo;, Cox, p. 522. Thomas gives the beginning of a lullaby which doubtlessly
belongs to this tune group, see <i>Devil&rsquo;s Ditties</i>, p. 17.</p>

<p>The recording of this tune is credited to Dr. R. R. Osborne, a Georgian. The
core of the words is by John Cennick, a text which is given more fully under
&lsquo;River of Jordan&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The tune is built up easily on the theme of the first two measures which is
similar to the beginning of &lsquo;Henry Martin&rsquo;, see Rickaby, p. 161, and Sandburg,
p. 176. &lsquo;Henry Martin&rsquo; is based on an incident in British marine history which
took place in the year 1476. See S. Baring-Gould, <i>Songs of the West</i>, song No. 53,
and note. Another old relative of the tune seems to be &lsquo;There were Three Ravens&rsquo;
which was recorded in 1611 as follows:</p>

<p>This is one of the best examples of the revival spiritual song. It has the John
Leland words of matchless popularity in the southern song region, a refrain in
clarion tones, a chorus with rare swing, and a primeval melodic mode.</p>

<i>White Spirituals</i>. See also my article &ldquo;Buckwheat Notes,&rdquo; in the <i>Musical Quarterly</i>, xix.,

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a>In Chapter xxi of <i>White Spirituals</i> is the story of how the city-controlled denominations
have shown uniformly and increasingly an aversion to the old revival type of song.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a>The following is a comment made in this connection by John Powell.</div>
<div class="fncont">&ldquo;It may be well to remember here that only in comparatively recent times has any distinction
been made between the use of already existing material (melodic and thematic) and the use of
material created by the composer. The Contrapuntists relied very largely on folk-music for their
basic material. Bach followed this example to a great extent; Handel not only did this but took
material composed by others at his own sweet will with no thought of deception and with no
contemporary reproach of plagiarism. Haydn, Beethoven, Schumann and Brahms followed
frequently the same practice. In the literary field in Elizabethan times it would be difficult to find
a play the fundamental material of which was not drawn from already existing sources. The word
<i>composer</i> literally means the one who puts together a piece. The material of this piece may, or
may not, be invented by such composer. These reflections would seem to explain and to justify
the modest claims of the American singing-school book compilers to authorship of songs, and
such thoughts should make us approach their labors, not with caviling, but with gratefulness for
their invaluable service to American traditional song.&rdquo;
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a>On examining the first 50 tunes of the Folk-Hymns in this collection, I find <i>within</i> their
melodic phrases a total of only 17 jumps of a fifth and 10 of a sixth. Sevenths and octaves&mdash;I
found but two each&mdash;appeared only as the intervals between the end note of one phrase and
the beginning note of the following one.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a>My own hearing of these tunes at the southern country singings has convinced me that the
dorian mode is far more widely used than the above statistics, based on the notation, indicate.
That is, I have heard the sixth clearly <i>raised</i> in numbers of songs where the key signature called
for a flatting.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a>Observations made in recent years of the folk-tunes in the British Isles show modality
to be on the decline. In Germany the modes are already practically gone, with the regular
major and minor scales taking their places.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_14" href="#fr_14">[14]</a>From this statement it will be seen that I hold with those who look on the full diatonic
scales as having evolved from the gapped ones, rather than the other way around. This however
is still a matter of controversy.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_15" href="#fr_15">[15]</a>To those who desire to follow in more detail the problem of the essence of the folk-tune,
I commend Cecil Sharp&rsquo;s <i>English Folk-Song, Some Conclusions</i>, especially chapters VI and
VII. Despite Sharp&rsquo;s having come to his &ldquo;conclusions&rdquo; thirty years ago and even though
they are concerned with the folk-songs of the British Isles only, they have not, to my knowledge,
been essentially altered by subsequent thought on the subject; and they apply, by and
large, to American folk-tunes as well.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_16" href="#fr_16">[16]</a>A real defect of this system of cataloguing inheres in the difficulty, sometimes the impossibility,
of determining the proper key signatures of gapped tunes. And the difficulty is augmented
by the tendency of all the old recorders to regard dorian tunes as natural minor ones (or aeolian).
I have reproduced all such doubtful tunes here just as I found them. I have catalogued
them, however, (and inserted them here serially according to that catalog arrangement) in an
order which is determined by what has seemed to be their proper modal form. Among the songs
which are touched by this modal (and hence key-signature) uncertainty are Nos. <a href="#h20">20</a>, <a href="#h21">21</a>, <a href="#h22">22</a>, <a href="#h37">37</a>,

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
